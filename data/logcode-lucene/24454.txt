-$Id$
-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-solved:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-
-Bugs:
-	- some relative URLs are not appended appropriately, leading to wrong and growing URLs
-	  - 301/302 URLs were not updated: the docs were saved under the old URL, which lead to
-	    wrong relative URLs (cmarschner, 2002-06-17)
-    - fixed build.xml
-    
-URLs: 
-	- include a URLNormalizer
-	  * lowercase host names
-	  * avoid ambiguities like '%20' / '+'
-	  * make sure http://host URLs end with "/"
-	  * avoid host name aliases
-	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to the same web site: www.lmu.de / www.uni-muenchen.de
-	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to different web sites (then other URLs / pages must differ)
-	      suche.lmu.de / interesse.lmu.de
-	  * cater 301/302 result codes
-	STATUS: seems to be solved except that URL parameters can occur in different orders, which is NOT resolved
-		host names are resolved by hand, via a synonym in HostManager. (cmarschner, 2002-06-17)
-		problem: URLMessage size doubles

-	- define a configurable interface that saves fetched pages into a Lucene index
-
-* Configuration

-
-* Tests
-	  - Put all tests into a JUnit test suite
-
-* distribution
-	- optionally send messages through a JMS topic. 
-	- create an executable that installs a source (like JMS, page files) and a storage pipeline

-
-
-1 Purpose and Intended Audience
-
-This document was made for Lucene developers, not necessarily with any
-background knowledge on crawlers, to understand the inner workings of the
-Fetcher crawler, the current problems and some directions for future
-development. The aim is to keep the entry costs low for people who have an
-interest in developing this piece of software further.
-
-2 Why do we need web crawlers?
-
-The answer is: Because the web is not perfect. It became necessary because
-the web standard protocols didn?? contain any mechanisms to inform search
-engines that the data on a web server had been changed. If this were
-possible, a search engine could be notified in a ??ush?? fashion, which
-would simplify the total process and would make indexes as current as
-possible.
-Imagine a web server that notifies another web server that a link was
-created from one of its pages to the other server. That other server could
-then send a message back if the page was removed.[1]
-On the other hand, this system would be a lot more complicated to handle.
-Keeping distributed information up to date is an erroneous task. Even in a
-single relational database it is often complicated to define and handle
-dependencies between relations. Should it be possible to allow
-inconsistencies for a short period of time? Should dependent data be
-deleted if a record is removed? Handling relationships between clusters of
-information well incorporates a new level of complexity.
-In order to keep the software (web servers and browsers) simple, the
-inventors of the web concentrated on just a few core elements ?? URLs for
-(more or less) uniquely identifying distributed information, HTTP for
-handling the information, and HTML for structuring it. That system was so
-simple that one could understand it in a very short time. This is probably
-one of the main reasons why the WWW became so popular. Well, another one
-would probably be coloured, moving graphics of naked people.
-But the WWW has some major disadvantages: There is no single index of all
-available pages. Information can change without notice. URLs can point to
-pages that no longer exist. There is no mechanism to get ??ll?? pages from a
-web server. The whole system is in a constant process of change. And after
-all, the whole thing is growing at phenomenal rates. Building a search
-engine on top of that is not something you can do on a Saturday afternoon.
-Given the sheer size, it would take months to search through all the pages
-in order to answer a single query, even if we had a means to get from
-server to server, get the pages from there, and search them. But we don??
-even know how to do that, since we don?? know all the web servers.
-That first problem was addressed by bookmark collections, which soon became
-very popular. The most popular probably was Yahoo, which evolved to one of
-the most popular pages in the web just a year after it emerged from a
-college dorm room.
-The second problem was how to get the information from all those pages
-laying around. This is where a web crawler comes in.
-Ok, those engineers said, we are not able to get a list of all the pages.
-But almost every page contains links to other pages. We can save a page,
-extract all the links, and load all of these pages these links point to. If
-we start at a popular location which contains a lot of links, like Yahoo
-for example, chances should be that we can get ??ll?? pages on the web.
-A little more formal, the web can be seen as a directional graph, with
-pages as nodes and links as edges between them. A web crawler, also called
-??pider?? or ??etcher??, uses the graph structure of the web to get documents
-in order to be able to index them. Since there is no ??ush?? mechanism for
-updating our index, we need to ??ull?? the information on our own, by
-repeatedly crawling the web.
-
-3 Implementation ?? the first attempt
-
-??asy??, you may think now, ??ust implement what he said in the paragraph
-before.?? So you start getting a page, extracting the links, following all
-the pages you have not already visited?? In Perl that can be done in a few
-lines of code.
-But then, very soon (I can tell you), you end up in a lot of problems:
-    - a server doesn?? respond. Your program always wait for it to time out
-    - you get OutOfMemory errors soon after the beginning
-    - your hard drive fills up
-    - You notice that one page is loaded again time after time, because the
-      URL changed a little
-    - Some servers will behave very strange. They will respond after 30
-      seconds, sometimes they time out, sometimes they are not accessible at
-      all
-    - some URLs will get longer and longer. Suddenly you will get URLs with
-      a length of thousands of characters.
-    - But the main problem will be: you notice that your network interface
-      card (NIC) is waiting, and your CPU is waiting. What?? going on? The
-      overall process will take days
-
-4 Features of the Fetcher crawler
-
-The Fetcher web crawler is a result of experiences with the errors as
-mentioned above, connected with a lot of monitoring to get the maximum out
-of the given system ressources. It  was designed with several different
-aspects in mind:
-    - Speed. This involves balancing the resources to prevent bottlenecks.
-      The crawler is multithreaded. A lot of work went in avoiding
-      synchronization between threads, i.e. by rewriting or replacing the
-      standard Java classes, which slows down multithreaded programs a lot
-    - Simplicity. The underlying scheme is quite modular and comprehensible.
-      See the description of the pipeline below
-    - Power. The modular design and the ease of the Java language makes
-      customisation simple
-    - Java. Although there are many crawlers around at the time when I
-      started to think about it (in Summer 2000), I couldn?? find a good
-      available implementation in Java. If this crawler would have to be
-      integrated in a Java search engine, a homogenous system would be an
-      advantage. And after all, I wanted to see if a fast implementation
-      could be done in this language.
-
-
-5 What the crawler can do for you, and what it cannot (yet)
-
-What it can do for you:
-    - Crawl a distinct set of the web, only restricted by a given regular
-      expression all pages have to match. The pages are saved into page
-      files of max. 50 MB and an index file that contains the links between
-      the URL and the position in the page file. Links are logged as well.
-      This is part of the standard LogStorage. Other storages exist as well
-      (see below)
-    - Crawling is done breadth first. Hosts are accessed in a round-robin
-      manner, to prevent the situation that all threads access one host at
-      once. However, at the moment there is no means to throttle access to a
-      server ?? the crawler works as fast as it can. There are also some
-      problems with this technique, as will be described below.
-    - The main part of the crawler is implemented as a pool of concurrent
-      threads, which speeds up I/O access
-    - The HTML link extractor has been optimised for speed. It was made 10 x
-      faster than a generic SAX parser implementation
-    - A lot of logging and monitoring is done, to be able to track down the
-      going-ons in the inside
-    - A lot of parts of the crawler have already been optimised to consume
-      not more  memory then needed. A lot of the internal queues are cached
-      on hard drive, for example. Only the HashMap of already crawled pages
-      and the HostInfo structures still completely remain in memory, thus
-      limiting the number of crawled hosts and the number of crawled pages.
-      At the moment, OutOfMemory errors are not prevented, so beware.
-    - URLs are passed through a pipeline of filters that limit, for example,
-      the length of a URL, load robots.txt the first time a host is
-      accessed, etc. This pipeline can be extended easily by adding a Java
-      class to the pipeline.
-    - The storage mechanism is also pluggable. One of the next issues would
-      be to include this storage mechanism into the pipeline, to allow a
-      seperation of logging, processing, and storage
-
-On the other hand, at the time of this writing, the crawler has not yet
-evolved into a production release. The reason is: until now, it just served
-me alone. These issues remain:
-    - The missing things as noted above
-    - There may be bugs which prevent it from running for longer than a
-      couple of hours. I noticed for example that very slowly system sockets
-      were eaten, although the Java code seemed to be ok. One reason why I
-      wanted to publish it now was to have other people have a look on the
-      code, to learn from their experiences and to let them find errors I
-      couldn?? see anymore.
-    - Only some of the configuration can be done with command line
-      parameters. The pipeline is put together in the startup procedure. It
-      should not be very hard to put that into a property file
-    - The ThreadMonitor is very experimental. It has evolved from a pure
-      monitoring mechanism to a central part of the whole crawler. It should
-      probably be refactored.
-    - Speed could still be optimised. Synchronization takes place too often
-    - After all, the crawler is not yet incorporated into the Lucene engine.
-
-
-    - URLs should be handled in a more intelligent manner. At the moment
-      ??ttp://host?id=1??, ??ttp://host/?id=1??, and
-      ??ttp://host/index.shtml?id=1?? are handled as three different URLs. It
-      also doesn?? recognize host aliases or mirrors. Other crawlers also
-      calculate finger prints of the pages loaded, to prevent loading
-      mirrors. This does not.
-    - No processing whatsoever is done on the documents (except extracting
-      the links). It should be decided how much of this is supposed to be
-      done within the crawler, and what should be done in a post processing
-      step
-    - Unix is the favoured operating system. I used a SUSE Linux with 2.2
-      kernel. I remember that I ran into problems with the I/O routines on
-      Windows machines. I haven?? tried it for a long time now, though.
-    - Only http is supported, no file server crawling with recurse directory
-      options, etc.
-    - It?? not polite. It sucks out the servers, which can impose DOS
-      (Denial of Service) problems
-
-6 Syntax and runtime behaviour
-
-The command line options are very simple:
-java [-server] [-Xmx<ZZ>mb] ??lasspath fetcher.jar
-de.lanlab.larm.fetcher.FetcherMain
-            -start STARTURL
-            -restrictto REGEX
-            [-threads[=10]]
--start      a start URL. Currently only one. It must be a valid http-URL,
-           including the http prefix
--restrictto a (Perl5) regular expression that all
-      If you are not familiar with regular expressions
--threads    the number of concurrent threads that crawl the pages. At this
-           time, more than 25 threads don?? provide any advantages because
-           synchronization effects and (probably) the overhead of the
-           scheduler slow the system down
-Java runtime options:
--server     starts the hot spot VM in server mode, which starts up a little
-           slower, but is faster during the run
--Xmx<ZZ>mb  sets the maximum size of the heap to <ZZ> mb. Should be a lot.
-           Set it to what you have
-
-You also have to provide a ??ogs/?? directory (won?? be created for you).
-You may also want to have a look at the source code, because some options
-cannot be dealt with from the outside at this time.
-
-What happens now?
-   1. The filter pipeline is built. The ScopeFilter is initialised with the
-      expression given by restrictto
-   2. The URL is put into the pipeline
-   3. The documents are fetched. If the mime type is text/html, links are
-      extracted and put back into the queue. The documents and URLs are
-      forwarded to the storage, which saves them
-   4. Meanwhile, every 5 seconds, the ThreadMonitor gathers statistics,
-      flushes log files, starts the garbage collection, and stops the
-      fetcher when everything seems to be done: all threads are idle, and
-      nothing is remaining in the queues
-
-   Architecture
-
-I studied the Mercator web crawler[2] but decided to implement a somewhat
-different architecture. Here is a high level overview of the default
-configuration:
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-

-
-
-
-
-The message handler is an implementation of a simple chain of
-responsibility. Implementations of Message are passed down a filter chain.
-Each of the filters can decide whether to send the message along, change
-it, or even delete it. In this case, Messages of type URLMessage are used.
-The message handler runs in its own thread. Thus, a call of putMessage() or
-putMessages() resp. involve a producer-consumer-like message transfer. The
-filters themselves run within the message handler thread.
-At the end of the pipeline the Fetcher distributes the incoming messages to
-its worker threads. They are implemented as a thread pool: Several
-ServerThreads are running concurrently and wait for Tasks which include the
-procedure to be executed. If more tasks are to be done than threads are
-available, they are kept in a queue, which will be read whenever a task is
-finished.
-At this point the pipeline pattern is left[3]. The FetcherTask itself is
-still quite monolithic. It gets the document, parses it if possible, and
-stores it into a storage. In the future one might think of additional
-configurable processing steps within another processing pipeline. I thought
-about incorporating it into the filter pipeline, but since the filters are
-passive components and the FetcherThreads are active, this didn?? work.
-
-1 Performance
-
-The performance was improved about 10-15 times compared to the first naïve
-attempts with a pre-built parser and Sun?? network classes. And there is
-still room left. On a network with about 150 web servers, which the crawler
-server was connected to by a 100 MBit FDDS connection, I was able to crawl
-an average of 60 documents per second, or 3,7 MB, after 10 minutes in the
-startup period. In this first period, crawling is slower because the number
-of servers is small, so the server output limits crawling. There may also
-be servers that don?? respond. They are excluded from the crawl after a few
-attempts.
-Overall, performance is affected by a lot of factors: The operating system,
-the native interface, the Java libraries, the web servers, the number of
-threads, whether dynamic pages are included in the crawl, etc.
-From a development side, the speed is affected by the balance between I/O
-and CPU usage. Both has to be kept at 100%, otherwise one of them becomes
-the bottleneck. Managing these resources is the central part of a crawler.
-Imagine that only one thread is crawling. This is the worst case, as can be
-seen very fast:

-The diagram to the right resembles a UML sequence diagram, except that it
-stresses the time that a message needs to traverse the network.
-1, The URL is processed somehow. That?? the filter part as stated above
-2. The request is sent. It goes through the different network layers of the
-crawler server. A TCP/IP connection is established. Several packets are
-sent back and forth. Then the crawler waits until the web server processes
-the request, looks up the file or renders the page (which can take several
-seconds or even minutes), then sends the file to the crawler.
-3. The crawler receives packet after packet, combines them to a file.
-Probably it is copied through several buffers until it is complete. This
-will take some CPU time, but mostly it will wait for the next packet to
-arrive. The network transfer by itself is also affected by a lot of
-factors, i.e. the speed of the web server, acknowledgement messages, resent
-packages etc. so 100% network utilization will almost never be reached.
-4. The document is processed, which will take up the whole CPU. The network
-will be idle at that time.
-The storage process, which by itself uses CPU and disk I/O resources, was
-left out here. That process will be very similar, although the traversal
-will be faster.
-As you can see, both CPU and I/O are not used most of the time, and wait
-for the other one (or the network) to complete. This is the reason why
-single threaded web crawlers tend to be very slow (wget for example). The
-slowest component always becomes the bottleneck.
-Two strategies can be followed to make this situation better:
-   1. use asynchronous I/O
-   2. use several threads
-Asynchronous I/O means, I/O requests are sent, but then the crawler
-continues to process documents it has already crawled.
-Actually I haven?? seen an implementation of this technique. Well,
-asynchronous I/O was not available in Java until version 1.4. An advantage
-would be that thread handling is also an expensive process in terms of CPU
-and memory usage. Threads are resources and, thus, limited. I heard that
-application server developers wanted asynchronous I/O, to be able to cope
-with hundreds of simultaneous requests without spawning extra threads for
-each of them. Probably this can be a solution in the future. But from what
-I know about it today, it will not be necessary
-The way this problem is solved usually in Java is with the use of several
-threads. If many threads are used, chances are good that at any given
-moment, at least one thread is in one of the states above, which means both
-CPU and I/O will be at a maximum.
-The problem with this is that multi threaded programming is considered to
-be one of the most difficult areas in computer science. But given the
-simple linear structure of web crawlers, it is not very hard to avoid race
-conditions or dead lock problems. You always get into problems when threads
-are supposed to access shared resources, though. Don?? touch this until you
-have read the standard literature and have made at least 10 mistakes (and
-solved them!)[4].
-Multithreading doesn?? come without a cost, however. First, there is the
-cost of thread scheduling. I don?? have numbers for that in Java, but I
-suppose that this should not be very expensive. MutExes can affect the
-whole program a lot[5]. I noticed that they should be avoided like hell. In
-a crawler, a MutEx is used, for example, when a new URL is passed to the
-thread, or when the fetched documents are supposed to be stored linearly,
-one after the other.
-For example, the tasks used to insert a new URL into the global message
-handler each time when a new URL was found in the document. I was able to
-speed it up considerably when I changed this so that the URLs are collected
-locally and then inserted only once per document. Probably this can be
-augmented even further if each task is comprised of several documents which
-are fetched one after the other and then stored together.
-Nonetheless, keeping the right balance between the two resources is a big
-concern. At the moment, the number of threads and the number of processing
-steps is static, and is only optimised by trial and error. Few hosts, slow
-network -> few threads. slow CPU -> few processing steps. many hosts, fast
-network -> many threads. Probably those heuristics will do well, but I
-wonder if these figures could also be fine-tuned dynamically during
-runtime.
-Another issue that was optimised were very fine-grained method calls. For
-example, the original implementation of the HTML parser used to call the
-read()-method for each character. This call had probably to traverse
-several Decorators until it got to a ?? synchronized call. That?? why the
-CharArrayReader was replaced by a SimpleCharArrayReader, because only one
-thread works on a document at a time.
-These issues can only be traced down with special tools, i.e. profilers.
-The work is worth it, because it allows one to work on the 20% of the code
-that costs 80% of the time.
-
-2 Memory Usage
-
-One ??eb crawler law?? could be defined as:
-      What can get infinite, will get infinite. Eventually. Very soon.
-A major task during the development was to get memory usage low. But a lot
-of work still needs to be done here. Most of the optimizations incorporated
-now move the problem from main memory to the hard disk, which doesn?? solve
-the problem.
-Here are some means that were used:
-    - CachingQueues: The message queue, the Fetcher queue, the robot
-      exclusion queue (see below) ?? a lot of queues can fill up the whole
-      main memory in a very short period of time. But since queues are only
-      accessed at their ends, a very simple mechanism was implemented to
-      keep memory usage low: The queue was divided into blocks of fixed
-      size. Only the two blocks at its end are kept in RAM. The rest is
-      serialized on disk. In the end, only a list of block references has to
-      be managed
-    - Define a maximum value for everything, and keep an eye on it.
-      Downloaded files can get ??nfinitely?? large. URLs can get infinitely
-      long. Servers may contain an infinite set of documents. A lot of these
-      checks had to be included even in the university network mentioned. A
-      special case were the URLs. Some .shtml pages on a web server pointed
-      to a subdirectory that didn?? exist but revealed the same page. If
-      these errors are introduced at will, they are called crawler traps: An
-      infinite URL space. The only way of dealing with this is manually
-      excluding the hosts.
-    - Optimized HTML parser. Current parsers tend to create a huge amount of
-      very small objects. Most of that work is unnecessary for the task to
-      be done. This can only be optimised by stripping down the parser to do
-      only what it is supposed to do in that special task.
-However, there still remains a problem: The HashMap of already visited URLs
-needs to be accessed randomly while reading and writing. I can imagine only
-two ways to overcome this:
-    - Limiting, in some way, the number of URLs in RAM. If the crawler were
-      distributed, this could be done by assigning only a certain number of
-      hosts to each crawler node, while at the same time limiting the number
-      of pages read from one host. In the end this will only limit the
-      number of hosts that can be crawled by the number of crawler nodes
-      available. Another solution would be to store complete hosts on drive,
-      together with the list of unresolved URLs. Again, this shifts the
-      problem only from RAM to the hard drive
-    - Something worth while would be to compress the URLs. A lot of parts of
-      URLs are the same between hundreds of URLs (i.e. the host name). And
-      since only a limited number of characters are allowed in URLs, Huffman
-      compression will lead to a good compression rate[6]. A first attempt
-      would be to incorporate the visited URLs hash into the HostInfo
-      structure.
-After all, the VisitedFilter hash map turned out to be the data structure
-that will take up most of the RAM after some time.
-
-3 The Filters
-
-Most of the functionality of the different filters has already been
-described. Here?? another, more detailed view[7]:
-
-1 RobotExclusionFilter
-
-The first implementation of this filter just kept a list of hosts, and
-every time a new URLMessage with an unknown host came by, it attempted to
-read the robots.txt file first to determine whether the URL should be
-filtered.
-A major drawback of that was that when the server was not accessible
-somehow, the whole crawler was held until the connection timed out (well
-with Sun?? classes that even didn?? happen, causing the whole program to
-die).
-The second implementation has its own little ThreadPool, and keeps a state
-machine of each host in the HostInfo structure.
-If the host manager doesn?? contain a HostInfo structure at all, the filter
-creates it and creates a task to get the robots.txt file. During this time,
-the host state is set to ??sLoadingRobotsTxt??, which means further requests
-to that host are put into a queue. When loading is finished, these URLs
-(and all subsequent ones) are put back to the beginning of the queue.
-After this initial step, every URL that enters the filter is compared to
-the disallow rules set (if present), and is filtered if necessary.
-Since the URLs are put back to the beginning of the queue, the filter has
-to be put in front of the VisitedFilter.
-In the host info structure, which is also used by the FetcherTasks, some
-information about the health of the hosts is stored as well. If the server
-is in a bad state several times, it is excluded from the crawl. Note that
-it is possible that a server will be accessed more than the (predefined) 5
-times that it can time out, since a FetcherThread may already have started
-to get a document when another one marks it as bad.
-
-2 URLLengthFilter
-
-This very simple filter just filters a URL if a certain (total) length is
-exceeded
-
-3 KnownPathsFilter
-
-This one filters some very common URLs (i.e. different views of an Apache
-directory index), or hosts known to make problems. Should be more
-configurable from outside in the future??
-
-4 URLScopeFilter
-
-The scope filter filters a URL if it doesn?? match a given regular
-expression.
-
-5 URLVisitedFilter
-
-This filter keeps a HashMap of already visited URLs, and filters out what
-it already knows
-
-6 Fetcher
-
-The fetcher itself is also a filter that filters all URLs ?? they are passed
-along to the storage as WebDocuments, in a different manner. It contains a
-ThreadPool that runs in its own thread of control, which takes tasks from
-the queue an distributes them to the different FetcherThreads.
-In the first implementation the fetcher would simply distribute the
-incoming URLs to the threads. The thread pool would use a simple queue to
-store the remaining tasks. But this can lead to a very ??npolite??
-distribution of the tasks: Since ¾ of the links in a page point to the same
-server, and all links of a page are added to the message handler at once,
-groups of successive tasks would all try to access the same server,
-probably causing denial of service, while other hosts present in the queue
-are not accessed.
-To overcome this, the queue is divided into different  parts, one for each
-host. Each host contains its own (caching) queue. But the methods used to
-pull tasks from the ??nd?? of this queue cycle through the hosts and always
-get a URL from a different host.
-One major problem still remains with this technique: If one host is very
-slow, it can still slow down everything. Since with n host every nth task
-will be accessed to this host, it can eat one thread after the other if
-loading a document takes longer than loading it from the (n-1) other
-servers. Then two concurrent requests will result on the same server, which
-slows down the response times even more, and so on. In reality, this will
-clog up the queue very fast. A little more work has to be done to avoid
-these situations, i.e. by limiting the number of threads that access one
-host at a time.
-
-7 A Note on DNS
-
-The Mercator crawler document stresses a lot on resolving host names.
-Because of that, a DNSResolver filter was implemented in the very first
-time. Two reasons prevented that it is used any more:
-    - newer versions of the JDK than the one Mercator used resolve the IP
-      address of a host the first time it is accessed, and keep a cache of
-      already resolved host names.
-    - the crawler itself was designed to crawl large local networks, and not
-      the internet. Thus, the number of hosts is very limited.
-
-
-
-   Future Enhancements
-
-
-1 ??oliteness??
-
-A crawler should not cause a Denial of Service attack. So this has to be
-addressed.
-
-2 The processing pipeline
-
-The FetcherTask, as already stated, is very monolithic at this time.
-Probably some more processing should be done at this step (the problem with
-balanced CPU/IO usage taken into account). At least different handlers for
-different mime types should be provided, i.e. to extract links from PDF
-documents. The Storage should also be broken up. I only used the LogStorage
-within the last months, which now doesn?? only writes to log files, but
-also stored the files on disk. This should probably be replaced by a
-storage chain where different stores could be appended.
-
-3 Lucene integration
-
-A very simple enhancement would be a LuceneStorage, which takes the
-document, parses it, and puts it into a Lucene store. But this will
-probably be very CPU intensive. Probably this should be done in a
-distributed environment.
-
-4 A Real Server
-
-The only way to start a crawl today is starting the crawler from the shell.
-But it could also remain idle and wait for commands from an RMI connection
-or expose a Web Service. Monitoring could be done by a simple included web
-server that provides current statistics via HTML
-
-5 Distribution
-
-Distribution is a big issue. Some people say ??istribute your program late.
-And then later.?? But as others have implemented distributed crawlers, this
-should not be very hard.
-I see two possible architectures for that:
-    - Write a single dispatcher (a star network) that contains the whole
-      MessageHandler except the Fetcher itself. The crawlers are run as
-      servers (see above), and are configured with a URL source that gets
-      their input from the dispatcher and a MessageHandler that stores URLs
-      back to the dispatcher. The main drawback being that this can become a
-      bottleneck.
-    - Partition the domain to be crawled into several parts. This could be
-      done for example by dividing up different intervals of the hash value
-      of the host names. Then plugging in another crawler could be done
-      dynamically, even within a peer to peer network. Each node knows which
-      node is responsible for which interval, and sends all URLs to the
-      right node. This could even be implemented as a filter.
-One thing to keep in mind is that the number of URLs transferred to other
-nodes should be as large as possible.
-The next thing to be distributed is the storage mechanism. Here, the number
-of pure crawling nodes and the number of storing (post processing) nodes
-could possibly diverge. An issue here is that the whole documents have to
-be transferred over the net.
-
-6 URL Reordering
-
-One paper discussed different types of reordering URLs while crawling[8].
-One of the most promising attempts was to take the calculated PageRank into
-account[9]. Crawling pages with higher PageRanks first seemed to get
-important pages earlier. Yes, this is not rocket science, folks, the
-research was already done years ago.
-
-
-7 Recovery
-
-At the moment there is no way of stopping and restarting a crawl.

-maximum speed gain of parallelization. See i.e. the ??mdahl law?? (I hope

-
- 1 Overview
-
-1.1 Purpose and Intended Audience
-
-       This document was made for Lucene developers, not necessarily with any background
-       knowledge on crawlers, to understand the inner workings of the Fetcher crawler, the current
-       problems and some directions for future development. The aim is to keep the entry costs low
-       for people who have an interest in developing this piece of software further.
-
-1.2 Why do we need web crawlers?
-
-       The answer is: Because the web is not perfect. It became necessary because the web standard
-       protocols didn?? contain any mechanisms to inform search engines that the data on a web
-       server had been changed. If this were possible, a search engine could be notified in a ??ush??
-       fashion, which would simplify the total process and would make indexes as current as
-       possible.
-       Imagine a web server that notifies another web server that a link was created from one of its
-       pages to the other server. That other server could then send a message back if the page was
-       removed.1
-       On the other hand, this system would be a lot more complicated to handle. Keeping
-       distributed information up to date is an erroneous task. Even in a single relational database it
-       is often complicated to define and handle dependencies between relations. Should it be
-       possible to allow inconsistencies for a short period of time? Should dependent data be
-       deleted if a record is removed? Handling relationships between clusters of information well
-       incorporates a new level of complexity.
-       In order to keep the software (web servers and browsers) simple, the inventors of the web
-       concentrated on just a few core elements ?? URLs for (more or less) uniquely identifying
-       distributed information, HTTP for handling the information, and HTML for structuring it.
-       That system was so simple that one could understand it in a very short time. This is probably
-       one of the main reasons why the WWW became so popular. Well, another one would
-       probably be coloured, moving graphics of naked people.
-       But the WWW has some major disadvantages: There is no single index of all available pages.
-       Information can change without notice. URLs can point to pages that no longer exist. There is
-       no mechanism to get ??ll?? pages from a web server. The whole system is in a constant
-       process of change. And after all, the whole thing is growing at phenomenal rates. Building a
-       search engine on top of that is not something you can do on a Saturday afternoon. Given the
-       sheer size, it would take months to search through all the pages in order to answer a single
-       query, even if we had a means to get from server to server, get the pages from there, and
-       search them. But we don?? even know how to do that, since we don?? know all the web
-       servers.
-       That first problem was addressed by bookmark collections, which soon became very
-       popular. The most popular probably was Yahoo, which evolved to one of the most popular
-       pages in the web just a year after it emerged from a college dorm room.
-       The second problem was how to get the information from all those pages laying around. This
-       is where a web crawler comes in.
-
-        1 I know that there is research on that matter.

-
-       Ok, those engineers said, we are not able to get a list of all the pages. But almost every page
-       contains links to other pages. We can save a page, extract all the links, and load all of these
-       pages these links point to. If we start at a popular location which contains a lot of links, like
-       Yahoo for example, chances should be that we can get ??ll?? pages on the web.
-       A little more formal, the web can be seen as a directional graph, with pages as nodes and
-       links as edges between them. A web crawler, also called ??pider?? or ??etcher??, uses the graph
-       structure of the web to get documents in order to be able to index them. Since there is no
-       ??ush?? mechanism for updating our index, we need to ??ull?? the information on our own,
-       by repeatedly crawling the web.
-
-1.3 Implementation ?? the first attempt
-
-       ??asy??, you may think now, ??ust implement what he said in the paragraph before.?? So you
-       start getting a page, extracting the links, following all the pages you have not already
-       visited?? In Perl that can be done in a few lines of code.
-       But then, very soon (I can tell you), you end up in a lot of problems:
-
-            - a server doesn?? respond. Your program always wait for it to time out
-            - you get OutOfMemory errors soon after the beginning
-            - your hard drive fills up
-            - You notice that one page is loaded again time after time, because the URL changed a
-
-                 little
-            - Some servers will behave very strange. They will respond after 30 seconds,
-
-                 sometimes they time out, sometimes they are not accessible at all
-            - some URLs will get longer and longer. Suddenly you will get URLs with a length of
-
-                 thousands of characters.
-            - But the main problem will be: you notice that your network interface card (NIC) is
-
-                 waiting, and your CPU is waiting. What?? going on? The overall process will take
-                 days
-
-1.4 Features of the Fetcher crawler
-
-       The Fetcher web crawler is a result of experiences with the errors as mentioned above,
-       connected with a lot of monitoring to get the maximum out of the given system ressources. It
-       was designed with several different aspects in mind:
-
-            - Speed. This involves balancing the resources to prevent bottlenecks. The crawler is
-                 multithreaded. A lot of work went in avoiding synchronization between threads, i.e.
-                 by rewriting or replacing the standard Java classes, which slows down multithreaded
-                 programs a lot
-
-            - Simplicity. The underlying scheme is quite modular and comprehensible. See the
-                 description of the pipeline below
-
-            - Power. The modular design and the ease of the Java language makes customisation
-                 simple
-
-            - Java. Although there are many crawlers around at the time when I started to think
-                 about it (in Summer 2000), I couldn?? find a good available implementation in Java. If
-                 this crawler would have to be integrated in a Java search engine, a homogenous
-                 system would be an advantage. And after all, I wanted to see if a fast implementation
-                 could be done in this language.

-
-1.5 What the crawler can do for you, and what it cannot (yet)
-
-       What it can do for you:
-            - Crawl a distinct set of the web, only restricted by a given regular expression all pages
-                 have to match. The pages are saved into page files of max. 50 MB and an index file
-                 that contains the links between the URL and the position in the page file. Links are
-                 logged as well. This is part of the standard LogStorage. Other storages exist as well
-                 (see below)
-            - Crawling is done breadth first. Hosts are accessed in a round-robin manner, to
-                 prevent the situation that all threads access one host at once. However, at the moment
-                 there is no means to throttle access to a server ?? the crawler works as fast as it can.
-                 There are also some problems with this technique, as will be described below.
-            - The main part of the crawler is implemented as a pool of concurrent threads, which
-                 speeds up I/O access
-            - The HTML link extractor has been optimised for speed. It was made 10 x faster than a
-                 generic SAX parser implementation
-            - A lot of logging and monitoring is done, to be able to track down the going-ons in the
-                 inside
-            - A lot of parts of the crawler have already been optimised to consume not more
-                 memory then needed. A lot of the internal queues are cached on hard drive, for
-                 example. Only the HashMap of already crawled pages and the HostInfo structures
-                 still completely remain in memory, thus limiting the number of crawled hosts and the
-                 number of crawled pages. At the moment, OutOfMemory errors are not prevented,
-                 so beware.
-            - URLs are passed through a pipeline of filters that limit, for example, the length of a
-                 URL, load robots.txt the first time a host is accessed, etc. This pipeline can be
-                 extended easily by adding a Java class to the pipeline.
-            - The storage mechanism is also pluggable. One of the next issues would be to include
-                 this storage mechanism into the pipeline, to allow a seperation of logging, processing,
-                 and storage
-
-       On the other hand, at the time of this writing, the crawler has not yet evolved into a
-       production release. The reason is: until now, it just served me alone. These issues remain:
-
-            - The missing things as noted above
-            - There may be bugs which prevent it from running for longer than a couple of hours. I
-
-                 noticed for example that very slowly system sockets were eaten, although the Java
-                 code seemed to be ok. One reason why I wanted to publish it now was to have other
-                 people have a look on the code, to learn from their experiences and to let them find
-                 errors I couldn?? see anymore.
-            - Only some of the configuration can be done with command line parameters. The
-                 pipeline is put together in the startup procedure. It should not be very hard to put
-                 that into a property file
-            - The ThreadMonitor is very experimental. It has evolved from a pure monitoring
-                 mechanism to a central part of the whole crawler. It should probably be refactored.
-            - Speed could still be optimised. Synchronization takes place too often
-            - After all, the crawler is not yet incorporated into the Lucene engine.
-            - URLs should be handled in a more intelligent manner. At the moment
-                 ??ttp://host?id=1??, ??ttp://host/?id=1??, and ??ttp://host/index.shtml?id=1?? are
-                 handled as three different URLs. It also doesn?? recognize host aliases or mirrors.

-
-    Other crawlers also calculate finger prints of the pages loaded, to prevent loading
-    mirrors. This does not.
-- No processing whatsoever is done on the documents (except extracting the links). It
-    should be decided how much of this is supposed to be done within the crawler, and
-    what should be done in a post processing step
-- Unix is the favoured operating system. I used a SUSE Linux with 2.2 kernel. I
-    remember that I ran into problems with the I/O routines on Windows machines. I
-    haven?? tried it for a long time now, though.
-- Only http is supported, no file server crawling with recurse directory options, etc.
-- It?? not polite. It sucks out the servers, which can impose DOS (Denial of Service)
-    problems
-
-1.6 Syntax and runtime behaviour
-
-The command line options are very simple:
-java [-server] [-Xmx<ZZ>mb] ??lasspath fetcher.jar de.lanlab.larm.fetcher.FetcherMain
-             -start STARTURL
-             -restrictto REGEX
-             [-threads[=10]]
--start       a start URL. Currently only one. It must be a valid http-URL, including the
-             http prefix
--restrictto a (Perl5) regular expression that all
-             If you are not familiar with regular expressions
--threads     the number of concurrent threads that crawl the pages. At this time, more than
-             25 threads don?? provide any advantages because synchronization effects and
-             (probably) the overhead of the scheduler slow the system down
-Java runtime options:
--server      starts the hot spot VM in server mode, which starts up a little slower, but is
-             faster during the run
--Xmx<ZZ>mbsets the maximum size of the heap to <ZZ> mb. Should be a lot. Set it to what
-                   you have
-
-You also have to provide a ??ogs/?? directory (won?? be created for you).
-You may also want to have a look at the source code, because some options cannot be dealt
-with from the outside at this time.
-
-What happens now?
-    1. The filter pipeline is built. The ScopeFilter is initialised with the expression given by
-         restrictto
-    2. The URL is put into the pipeline
-    3. The documents are fetched. If the mime type is text/html, links are extracted and put
-         back into the queue. The documents and URLs are forwarded to the storage, which
-         saves them
-    4. Meanwhile, every 5 seconds, the ThreadMonitor gathers statistics, flushes log files,
-         starts the garbage collection, and stops the fetcher when everything seems to be done:
-         all threads are idle, and nothing is remaining in the queues

-2 Architecture

-     I studied the Mercator web crawler2 but decided to implement a somewhat different

-                                                           FetcherThread

-
-The message handler is an implementation of a simple chain of responsibility. Implementations
-of Message are passed down a filter chain. Each of the filters can decide whether to send the
-message along, change it, or even delete it. In this case, Messages of type URLMessage are
-used. The message handler runs in its own thread. Thus, a call of putMessage() or
-putMessages() resp. involve a producer-consumer-like message transfer. The filters themselves
-run within the message handler thread.
-At the end of the pipeline the Fetcher distributes the incoming messages to its worker
-threads. They are implemented as a thread pool: Several ServerThreads are running
-concurrently and wait for Tasks which include the procedure to be executed. If more tasks are
-to be done than threads are available, they are kept in a queue, which will be read whenever
-a task is finished.
-At this point the pipeline pattern is left3. The FetcherTask itself is still quite monolithic. It gets
-the document, parses it if possible, and stores it into a storage. In the future one might think
-2 see http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/heydon99mercator.html
-3 probably this will be one of the foremost places to work on

-of additional configurable processing steps within another processing pipeline. I thought
-about incorporating it into the filter pipeline, but since the filters are passive components and
-the FetcherThreads are active, this didn?? work.
-
-2.1 Performance
-
-       The performance was improved about 10-15 times compared to the first naïve attempts with
-       a pre-built parser and Sun?? network classes. And there is still room left. On a network with
-       about 150 web servers, which the crawler server was connected to by a 100 MBit FDDS
-       connection, I was able to crawl an average of 60 documents per second, or 3,7 MB, after 10
-       minutes in the startup period. In this first period, crawling is slower because the number of
-       servers is small, so the server output limits crawling. There may also be servers that don??
-       respond. They are excluded from the crawl after a few attempts.
-       Overall, performance is affected by a lot of factors: The operating system, the native
-       interface, the Java libraries, the web servers, the number of threads, whether dynamic pages
-       are included in the crawl, etc.
-       From a development side, the speed is affected by the balance between I/O and CPU usage.
-       Both has to be kept at 100%, otherwise one of them becomes the bottleneck. Managing these
-       resources is the central part of a crawler.
-       Imagine that only one thread is crawling. This is the worst case, as can be seen very fast:
-
-Action        CPU Usage  I/O Usage                          :Crawler  Network  :Web Server
-
-1. Process URL 100%      0%
-
-2. Send Request <10%?    <100%
-                         0%
-3. Wait       0%
-
-4. Receive    <10%?      <100%
-
-Process Doc.  100%       0%
-
-The diagram to the right resembles a UML sequence diagram, except that it stresses the time
-that a message needs to traverse the network.
-1, The URL is processed somehow. That?? the filter part as stated above
-2. The request is sent. It goes through the different network layers of the crawler server. A
-TCP/IP connection is established. Several packets are sent back and forth. Then the crawler
-waits until the web server processes the request, looks up the file or renders the page (which
-can take several seconds or even minutes), then sends the file to the crawler.
-3. The crawler receives packet after packet, combines them to a file. Probably it is copied
-through several buffers until it is complete. This will take some CPU time, but mostly it will
-wait for the next packet to arrive. The network transfer by itself is also affected by a lot of

-
-factors, i.e. the speed of the web server, acknowledgement messages, resent packages etc. so
-100% network utilization will almost never be reached.
-4. The document is processed, which will take up the whole CPU. The network will be idle at
-that time.
-The storage process, which by itself uses CPU and disk I/O resources, was left out here. That
-process will be very similar, although the traversal will be faster.
-As you can see, both CPU and I/O are not used most of the time, and wait for the other one
-(or the network) to complete. This is the reason why single threaded web crawlers tend to be
-very slow (wget for example). The slowest component always becomes the bottleneck.
-Two strategies can be followed to make this situation better:
-
-    1. use asynchronous I/O
-    2. use several threads
-Asynchronous I/O means, I/O requests are sent, but then the crawler continues to process
-documents it has already crawled.
-Actually I haven?? seen an implementation of this technique. Well, asynchronous I/O was
-not available in Java until version 1.4. An advantage would be that thread handling is also an
-expensive process in terms of CPU and memory usage. Threads are resources and, thus,
-limited. I heard that application server developers wanted asynchronous I/O, to be able to
-cope with hundreds of simultaneous requests without spawning extra threads for each of
-them. Probably this can be a solution in the future. But from what I know about it today, it
-will not be necessary
-The way this problem is solved usually in Java is with the use of several threads. If many
-threads are used, chances are good that at any given moment, at least one thread is in one of
-the states above, which means both CPU and I/O will be at a maximum.
-The problem with this is that multi threaded programming is considered to be one of the
-most difficult areas in computer science. But given the simple linear structure of web
-crawlers, it is not very hard to avoid race conditions or dead lock problems. You always get
-into problems when threads are supposed to access shared resources, though. Don?? touch
-this until you have read the standard literature and have made at least 10 mistakes (and
-solved them!)4.
-Multithreading doesn?? come without a cost, however. First, there is the cost of thread
-scheduling. I don?? have numbers for that in Java, but I suppose that this should not be very
-expensive. MutExes can affect the whole program a lot5. I noticed that they should be
-avoided like hell. In a crawler, a MutEx is used, for example, when a new URL is passed to
-the thread, or when the fetched documents are supposed to be stored linearly, one after the
-other.
-For example, the tasks used to insert a new URL into the global message handler each time
-when a new URL was found in the document. I was able to speed it up considerably when I
-changed this so that the URLs are collected locally and then inserted only once per

-5 the sequential part of a parallel program has a massive effect on the maximum speed gain of
-parallelization. See i.e. the ??mdahl law?? (I hope this can be transferred to a single-processor,
-multithreaded system) in Amdahl, G.: The validity of the single processor approach to achieving large

-       document. Probably this can be augmented even further if each task is comprised of several
-       documents which are fetched one after the other and then stored together.
-       Nonetheless, keeping the right balance between the two resources is a big concern. At the
-       moment, the number of threads and the number of processing steps is static, and is only
-       optimised by trial and error. Few hosts, slow network -> few threads. slow CPU -> few
-       processing steps. many hosts, fast network -> many threads. Probably those heuristics will
-       do well, but I wonder if these figures could also be fine-tuned dynamically during runtime.
-       Another issue that was optimised were very fine-grained method calls. For example, the
-       original implementation of the HTML parser used to call the read()-method for each
-       character. This call had probably to traverse several Decorators until it got to a ?? synchronized
-       call. That?? why the CharArrayReader was replaced by a SimpleCharArrayReader, because
-       only one thread works on a document at a time.
-       These issues can only be traced down with special tools, i.e. profilers. The work is worth it,
-       because it allows one to work on the 20% of the code that costs 80% of the time.
-
-2.2 Memory Usage
-
-       One ??eb crawler law?? could be defined as:
-                               What can get infinite, will get infinite. Eventually. Very soon.
-
-       A major task during the development was to get memory usage low. But a lot of work still
-       needs to be done here. Most of the optimizations incorporated now move the problem from
-       main memory to the hard disk, which doesn?? solve the problem.
-       Here are some means that were used:
-
-            - CachingQueues: The message queue, the Fetcher queue, the robot exclusion queue
-                 (see below) ?? a lot of queues can fill up the whole main memory in a very short
-                 period of time. But since queues are only accessed at their ends, a very simple
-                 mechanism was implemented to keep memory usage low: The queue was divided
-                 into blocks of fixed size. Only the two blocks at its end are kept in RAM. The rest is
-                 serialized on disk. In the end, only a list of block references has to be managed
-
-            - Define a maximum value for everything, and keep an eye on it. Downloaded files can
-                 get ??nfinitely?? large. URLs can get infinitely long. Servers may contain an infinite set
-                 of documents. A lot of these checks had to be included even in the university network
-                 mentioned. A special case were the URLs. Some .shtml pages on a web server pointed
-                 to a subdirectory that didn?? exist but revealed the same page. If these errors are
-                 introduced at will, they are called crawler traps: An infinite URL space. The only way
-                 of dealing with this is manually excluding the hosts.
-
-            - Optimized HTML parser. Current parsers tend to create a huge amount of very small
-                 objects. Most of that work is unnecessary for the task to be done. This can only be
-                 optimised by stripping down the parser to do only what it is supposed to do in that
-                 special task.
-
-       However, there still remains a problem: The HashMap of already visited URLs needs to be
-       accessed randomly while reading and writing. I can imagine only two ways to overcome this:
-
-            - Limiting, in some way, the number of URLs in RAM. If the crawler were distributed,
-                 this could be done by assigning only a certain number of hosts to each crawler node,
-                 while at the same time limiting the number of pages read from one host. In the end
-                 this will only limit the number of hosts that can be crawled by the number of crawler
-                 nodes available. Another solution would be to store complete hosts on drive, together
-

-
-         with the list of unresolved URLs. Again, this shifts the problem only from RAM to
-         the hard drive
-    - Something worth while would be to compress the URLs. A lot of parts of URLs are
-         the same between hundreds of URLs (i.e. the host name). And since only a limited
-         number of characters are allowed in URLs, Huffman compression will lead to a good
-         compression rate6. A first attempt would be to incorporate the visited URLs hash into
-         the HostInfo structure.
-After all, the VisitedFilter hash map turned out to be the data structure that will take up most
-of the RAM after some time.

-
-2.3 The Filters
-
-       Most of the functionality of the different filters has already been described. Here?? another,
-       more detailed view7:
-
-2.3.1  RobotExclusionFilter
-       The first implementation of this filter just kept a list of hosts, and every time a new
-       URLMessage with an unknown host came by, it attempted to read the robots.txt file first to
-       determine whether the URL should be filtered.
-       A major drawback of that was that when the server was not accessible somehow, the whole
-       crawler was held until the connection timed out (well with Sun?? classes that even didn??
-       happen, causing the whole program to die).
-       The second implementation has its own little ThreadPool, and keeps a state machine of each
-       host in the HostInfo structure.
-       If the host manager doesn?? contain a HostInfo structure at all, the filter creates it and creates
-       a task to get the robots.txt file. During this time, the host state is set to ??sLoadingRobotsTxt??,
-       which means further requests to that host are put into a queue. When loading is finished,
-       these URLs (and all subsequent ones) are put back to the beginning of the queue.
-       After this initial step, every URL that enters the filter is compared to the disallow rules set (if
-       present), and is filtered if necessary.
-       Since the URLs are put back to the beginning of the queue, the filter has to be put in front of
-       the VisitedFilter.
-       In the host info structure, which is also used by the FetcherTasks, some information about
-       the health of the hosts is stored as well. If the server is in a bad state several times, it is
-       excluded from the crawl. Note that it is possible that a server will be accessed more than the
-       (predefined) 5 times that it can time out, since a FetcherThread may already have started to
-       get a document when another one marks it as bad.
-
-2.3.2 URLLengthFilter
-         This very simple filter just filters a URL if a certain (total) length is exceeded
-
-2.3.3 KnownPathsFilter
-         This one filters some very common URLs (i.e. different views of an Apache directory index),
-         or hosts known to make problems. Should be more configurable from outside in the future??
-
-2.3.4 URLScopeFilter
-         The scope filter filters a URL if it doesn?? match a given regular expression.
-
-2.3.5 URLVisitedFilter
-         This filter keeps a HashMap of already visited URLs, and filters out what it already knows
-
-2.3.6 Fetcher
-         The fetcher itself is also a filter that filters all URLs ?? they are passed along to the storage as
-         WebDocuments, in a different manner. It contains a ThreadPool that runs in its own thread
-
-       7 this chapter will probably be left out in future revisions, since that information can also be found in
-       the Javadoc and the source code. Or do you disagree?
-
-       Version: 12                                                                           12 / 15
-       The Fetcher Web Crawler ?? Technical Overview ?? Version 0.5
-
-       of control, which takes tasks from the queue an distributes them to the different
-       FetcherThreads.
-       In the first implementation the fetcher would simply distribute the incoming URLs to the
-       threads. The thread pool would use a simple queue to store the remaining tasks. But this can
-       lead to a very ??npolite?? distribution of the tasks: Since ¾ of the links in a page point to the
-       same server, and all links of a page are added to the message handler at once, groups of
-       successive tasks would all try to access the same server, probably causing denial of service,
-       while other hosts present in the queue are not accessed.
-       To overcome this, the queue is divided into different parts, one for each host. Each host
-       contains its own (caching) queue. But the methods used to pull tasks from the ??nd?? of this
-       queue cycle through the hosts and always get a URL from a different host.
-       One major problem still remains with this technique: If one host is very slow, it can still slow
-       down everything. Since with n host every nth task will be accessed to this host, it can eat one
-       thread after the other if loading a document takes longer than loading it from the (n-1) other
-       servers. Then two concurrent requests will result on the same server, which slows down the
-       response times even more, and so on. In reality, this will clog up the queue very fast. A little
-       more work has to be done to avoid these situations, i.e. by limiting the number of threads
-       that access one host at a time.
-
-2.3.7  A Note on DNS
-       The Mercator crawler document stresses a lot on resolving host names. Because of that, a
-       DNSResolver filter was implemented in the very first time. Two reasons prevented that it is
-       used any more:
-
-           - newer versions of the JDK than the one Mercator used resolve the IP address of a host
-                the first time it is accessed, and keep a cache of already resolved host names.
-
-           - the crawler itself was designed to crawl large local networks, and not the internet.
-                Thus, the number of hosts is very limited.
-

-
- 3 Future Enhancements
-
-3.1 ??oliteness??
-
-       A crawler should not cause a Denial of Service attack. So this has to be addressed.
-
-3.2 The processing pipeline
-
-       The FetcherTask, as already stated, is very monolithic at this time. Probably some more
-       processing should be done at this step (the problem with balanced CPU/IO usage taken into
-       account). At least different handlers for different mime types should be provided, i.e. to
-       extract links from PDF documents. The Storage should also be broken up. I only used the
-       LogStorage within the last months, which now doesn?? only writes to log files, but also
-       stored the files on disk. This should probably be replaced by a storage chain where different
-       stores could be appended.
-
-3.3 Lucene integration
-
-       A very simple enhancement would be a LuceneStorage, which takes the document, parses it,
-       and puts it into a Lucene store. But this will probably be very CPU intensive. Probably this
-       should be done in a distributed environment.
-
-3.4 A Real Server
-
-       The only way to start a crawl today is starting the crawler from the shell. But it could also
-       remain idle and wait for commands from an RMI connection or expose a Web Service.
-       Monitoring could be done by a simple included web server that provides current statistics
-       via HTML
-
-3.5 Distribution
-
-       Distribution is a big issue. Some people say ??istribute your program late. And then later.??
-       But as others have implemented distributed crawlers, this should not be very hard.
-       I see two possible architectures for that:
-
-            - Write a single dispatcher (a star network) that contains the whole MessageHandler
-                 except the Fetcher itself. The crawlers are run as servers (see above), and are
-                 configured with a URL source that gets their input from the dispatcher and a
-                 MessageHandler that stores URLs back to the dispatcher. The main drawback being
-                 that this can become a bottleneck.
-
-            - Partition the domain to be crawled into several parts. This could be done for example
-                 by dividing up different intervals of the hash value of the host names. Then plugging
-                 in another crawler could be done dynamically, even within a peer to peer network.
-                 Each node knows which node is responsible for which interval, and sends all URLs to
-                 the right node. This could even be implemented as a filter.
-
-       One thing to keep in mind is that the number of URLs transferred to other nodes should be
-       as large as possible.
-

-           The Fetcher Web Crawler ?? Technical Overview ?? Version 0.5
-
-       The next thing to be distributed is the storage mechanism. Here, the number of pure
-       crawling nodes and the number of storing (post processing) nodes could possibly diverge.
-       An issue here is that the whole documents have to be transferred over the net.
-
-3.6 URL Reordering
-
-       One paper discussed different types of reordering URLs while crawling8. One of the most
-       promising attempts was to take the calculated PageRank into account9. Crawling pages with
-       higher PageRanks first seemed to get important pages earlier. Yes, this is not rocket science,
-       folks, the research was already done years ago.
-
-3.7 Recovery
-
-       At the moment there is no way of stopping and restarting a crawl.

-The answer is: Because the web is not perfect. It became necessary because the web standard protocols didn\rquote t contain any mechanisms to inform search engines that the data on a web server had been changed. If this were possible, a search engine c
-ould be notified in a \'93push\'94 fashion, which would simplify the total process and would make indexes as current as possible. 
-\par Imagine a web server that notifies another web server that a link was created from one of its pages to the other server. That other server could then send a message back if the page was removed.}{\cs39\lang2057\langfe1031\super\langnp2057 \chftn

-\par On the other hand, this system would be a lot more complicated to handle. Keeping distributed information up to date is an erroneous task. Even in a single relational database it is often co
-mplicated to define and handle dependencies between relations. Should it be possible to allow inconsistencies for a short period of time? Should dependent data be deleted if a record is removed? Handling relationships between clusters of information well 
-incorporates a new level of complexity.
-\par In order to keep the software (web servers and browsers) simple, the inventors of the web concentrated on just a few core elements \endash  URLs for (more or less) uniquely identifying distributed information, HTTP for handl
-ing the information, and HTML for structuring it. That system was so simple that one could understand it in a very short time. This is probably one of the main reasons why the WWW became so popular. Well, another one would probably be coloured, moving gra
-phics of naked people.
-\par But the WWW has some major disadvantages: There is no single index of all available pages. Information can change without notice. URLs can point to pages that no longer exist. There is no mechanism to get \'93all\'94 pages from a web server
-. The whole system is in a constant process of change. And after all, the whole thing is growing at phenomenal rates. Building a search engine on top of that is not something you can do on a Saturday afternoon. Given the sheer size, it would take months t
-o search through all the pages in order to answer a single query, even if we had a means to get from server to server, get the pages from there, and search them. But we don\rquote t even know how to do }{\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 that}{
-\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 , since we don\rquote t know all the web servers.
-\par That first problem was addressed by bookmark collections, which soon became very popular. The most popular probably was Yahoo, which evolved to one of the most popular pages in the web just a year after it emerged from a college dorm room.
-\par The second problem was how to get the information from all those pages laying around. This is where a web crawler comes in.
-\par Ok, those engineers said, we are not able to get a list of all the pages. But almost every page contains links to other pages. We can save a page, extract all the 
-links, and load all of these pages these links point to. If we start at a popular location which contains a lot of links, like Yahoo for example, chances should be that we can get \'93all\'94 pages on the web. 
-\par A little more formal, the web can be seen as a directional graph, with pages as nodes and links as edges between them. A web crawler, also called \'93spider\'94 or \'93fetcher\'94
-, uses the graph structure of the web to get documents in order to be able to index them. Since there is no \'93push\'94 mechanism for updating our index, we need to \'93pull\'94 the information on our own, by repeatedly crawling the web.

-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}The main part of the crawler is implemented as a pool of concurrent threads, which speeds up I/O access
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}The HTML link extractor has been optimised for speed. It was made 10 x faster than a generic SAX parser implementation
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}A lot of logging and monitoring is done, to be able to track down the going-ons in the inside
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}A lot of parts of the crawler have already been optimi
-sed to consume not more  memory then needed. A lot of the internal queues are cached on hard drive, for example. Only the HashMap of already crawled pages and the HostInfo structures still completely remain in memory, thus limiting the number of crawled h
-osts and the number of crawled pages. At the moment, OutOfMemory errors are not prevented, so beware. 
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}URLs are passed through a pipeline of filters that limit, for example, the length of a URL, load robots.txt the first time a host is accessed, etc. This p
-ipeline can be extended easily by adding a Java class to the pipeline.
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}
-The storage mechanism is also pluggable. One of the next issues would be to include this storage mechanism into the pipeline, to allow a seperation of logging, processing, and storage

-\par On the other hand, at the time of this writing, the crawler has not yet evolved into a production release. The reason is: until now, it just served me alone. These issues remain:

-The missing things as noted above
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}There may be bugs which prevent it from ru
-nning for longer than a couple of hours. I noticed for example that very slowly system sockets were eaten, although the Java code seemed to be ok. One reason why I wanted to publish it now was to have other people have a look on the code, to learn from th
-eir experiences and to let them find errors I couldn\rquote t see anymore.
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}
-Only some of the configuration can be done with command line parameters. The pipeline is put together in the startup procedure. It should not be very hard to put that into a property file
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}The ThreadMonitor is very experimental. It has evolved from a pure monitoring mechanism to a central part of the whole crawler. It should probably be refactored.
-
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}Speed could still be optimised. Synchronization takes place too often
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}After all, the crawler is not yet incorporated into the Lucene engine. 
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}URLs should be handled in a more intelligent manner. At the moment \'93http://host?id=1\'94, \'93http://host/?id=1\'94, and \'93http://host/index.shtml?id=1\'94
- are handled as three different URLs. It also doesn\rquote t recognize host aliases or mirrors. Other crawlers also calculate finger prints of the pages loaded, to prevent loading mirrors. This does not.
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}No processing whatsoever is done on the documents (except extracting the links). It should be decided how much of this is supp
-osed to be done within the crawler, and what should be done in a post processing step
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}Unix is the favoured operating system. I used a SUSE Linux with 2.2 kernel. I remember that I ran into problems with the I/O routines on Windows machines. I haven
-\rquote t tried it for a long time now, though.
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}Only http is supported, no file server crawling with recurse directory options, etc.
-\par {\listtext\pard\plain\fs22\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 -\tab}It\rquote s not polite. It sucks out the servers, which can impose DOS (Denial of Service) problems

-\par The message handler is an implementation of a simple }{\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 chain of responsibility}{\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 . Implementations of }{\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 Message}{\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 
- are passed down a filter chain. Each of the filters can decide whether to send the message along, change it, or even delete it. In this case, Messages of type URLMessage are used. The message handler runs in its own thread. Thus, a call of }{
-\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 putMessage()}{\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057  or }{\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 putMessages()}{\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057  resp. involve a }{\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 producer-consumer-}{

-ve attempts with a pre-built parser and Sun\rquote s network classes. And there is still room left. On a network with about 150 web servers, which the crawler 
-server was connected to by a 100 MBit FDDS connection, I was able to crawl an average of 60 documents per second, or 3,7 MB, after 10 minutes in the startup period. In this first period, crawling is slower because the number of servers is small, so the se
-rver output limits crawling. There may also be servers that don\rquote t respond. They are excluded from the crawl after a few attempts.
-\par Overall, performance is affected by a lot of factors: The operating system, the native interface, the Java libraries, the web servers, the number of threads, whether dynamic pages are included in the crawl, etc. 
-\par From a development side, the speed is affected by the balance between I/O and CPU usage. Both has to be kept at 100%, otherwise one of them becomes the bottleneck. Managing these resources is the central part of a crawler. 
-\par Imagine that only one thread is crawling. This is the worst case, as can be seen very fast:

-\par The diagram to the right resembles a UML sequence diagram, except that it stresses the time that a message needs to traverse the network.
-\par 1, The URL is processed somehow. That\rquote s the filter part as stated above
-\par 2. The request is sent. It goes through the different network layers of the crawler server. A TCP/IP connection is established. Several packets are sent back and forth. Then the crawler waits until the web server proc
-esses the request, looks up the file or renders the page (which can take several seconds or even minutes), then sends the file to the crawler.
-\par 3. The crawler receives packet after packet, combines them to a file. Probably it is copied through several buffe
-rs until it is complete. This will take some CPU time, but mostly it will wait for the next packet to arrive. The network transfer by itself is also affected by a lot of factors, i.e. the speed of the web server, acknowledgement messages, resent packages 
-etc. so 100% network utilization will almost never be reached.
-\par 4. The document is processed, which will take up the whole CPU. The network will be idle at that time.
-\par The storage process, which by itself uses CPU and disk I/O resources, was left out here. That process will be very similar, although the traversal will be faster.
-\par As you can see, both CPU and I/O are not used most of the time, and wait for the other one (or the network) to complete. This is the reason why single threaded web crawlers tend to be 
-very slow (wget for example). The slowest component always becomes the bottleneck.
-\par Two strategies can be followed to make this situation better:

-\par Actually I haven\rquote t seen an implementation of this technique. Well, asynchronous I/O was not available in Java until version 1.4. An advantage would be that thread handling is also an expensive process in
- terms of CPU and memory usage. Threads are resources and, thus, limited. I heard that application server developers wanted asynchronous I/O, to be able to cope with hundreds of simultaneous requests without spawning extra threads for each of them. Probab
-ly this can be a solution in the future. But from what I know about it today, it will not be necessary 
-\par The way this problem is solved usually in Java is with the use of several threads. If many threads are used, chances are good that at any given moment, at least one thread is in one of the states above, which means both CPU and I/O will be at a maximum.
-
-\par The problem with this is that multi threaded programming is considered to be one of the most difficult areas in computer science. But given the simple line
-ar structure of web crawlers, it is not very hard to avoid race conditions or dead lock problems. You always get into problems when threads are supposed to access shared resources, though. Don\rquote

-. I noticed that they should be avoided like hell. In a crawler, a MutEx is used, for example, when a new URL is passed to the thread, or when the fetched documents are supposed to be stored linearly, one after the other.
-\par For 
-example, the tasks used to insert a new URL into the global message handler each time when a new URL was found in the document. I was able to speed it up considerably when I changed this so that the URLs are collected locally and then inserted only once p
-er document. Probably this can be augmented even further if each task is comprised of several documents which are fetched one after the other and then stored together.
-\par Nonetheless, keeping the right balance between the two resources is a big concern. At the
- moment, the number of threads and the number of processing steps is static, and is only optimised by trial and error. Few hosts, slow network -> few threads. slow CPU -> few processing steps. many hosts, fast network -> many threads. Probably those heuri
-stics will do well, but I wonder if these figures could also be fine-tuned dynamically during runtime.
-\par Another issue that was optimised were very fine-grained method calls. For example, the original implementation of the HTML parser used to call the read()-method for each character. This call had probably to traverse several }{
-\i\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057 Decorators}{\lang2057\langfe1031\langnp2057  until it got to a \endash  synchronized call. That\rquote 
-s why the CharArrayReader was replaced by a SimpleCharArrayReader, because only one thread works on a document at a time.
-\par These issues can only be traced down with special tools, i.e. profilers. The work is worth it, because it allows one to work on the 20% of the code that costs 80% of the time.

-The first implementation of this filter just kept a list of hosts, and every time a new URLMessage with an unknown host came by, it attempted to read the robots.txt file first to determine whether the URL should be filtered.
-\par A major drawback of that was that when the server was not accessible somehow, the whole crawler was held until the connection timed out (well with Sun\rquote s classes that even didn\rquote t happen, causing the whole program to die). 
-\par The second implementation has its own little ThreadPool, and keeps a state machine of each host in the HostInfo structure.
-\par If the host manager doesn\rquote t contain a HostInfo structure at all, the filter creates it and creates a task to get the robots.txt file. During this time, the host state is set to \'93isLoadingRobotsTxt\'94
-, which means further requests to that host are put into a queue. When loading is finished, these URLs (and all subsequent ones) are put back to the beginning of the queue.
-\par After this initial step, every URL that enters the filter is compared to the disallow rules set (if present), and is filtered if necessary. 
-\par Since the URLs are put back to the beginning of the queue, the filter has to be put in front of the VisitedFilter. 
-\par In the host info structure, which is also used by the FetcherTasks, some information about the health of the hosts is stored as well. If the server is in a bad state several times, it is excluded from
- the crawl. Note that it is possible that a server will be accessed more than the (predefined) 5 times that it can time out, since a FetcherThread may already have started to get a document when another one marks it as bad.

-/**
- * This class implements http protocol requests; it contains most of HTTP/1.1
- * and ought to be unconditionally compliant. Redirections are automatically
- * handled, and authorizations requests are recognized and dealt with via an
- * authorization handler. Only full HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 requests are
- * generated. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/0.9 responses are recognized. <P>
- *
- * Using the HTTPClient should be quite simple. First add the import statement '
- * <code>import HTTPClient.*;</code>' to your file(s). Request can then be sent
- * using one of the methods <var>Head()</var> , <var>Get()</var> , <var>Post()
- * </var>, etc in <var>HTTPConnection</var> . These methods all return an
- * instance of <var>HTTPResponse</var> which has methods for accessing the
- * response headers (<var>getHeader()</var> , <var>getHeaderAsInt()</var> ,
- * etc), various response info (<var>getStatusCode()</var> , <var>
- * getReasonLine()</var> , etc) and the reponse data (<var>getData()</var> ,
- * <var>getText()</var> , and <var>getInputStream()</var> ). Following are some
- * examples. <P>
- *
- * If this is in an applet you can retrieve files from your server as follows:
- * <PRE>
- *     try
- *     {
- *         HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
- *         HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Get("/my_file");
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             data = rsp.getData();
- *
- *         rsp = con.Get("/another_file");
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             other_data = rsp.getData();
- *     }
- *     catch (IOException ioe)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println(ioe.toString());
- *     }
- *     catch (ModuleException me)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
- *     }
- * </PRE> This will get the files "/my_file" and "/another_file" and put their
- * contents into byte[]'s accessible via <code>getData()</code>. Note that you
- * need to only create a new <var>HTTPConnection</var> when sending a request to
- * a new server (different host or port); although you may create a new <var>
- * HTTPConnection</var> for every request to the same server this <strong>not
- * </strong> recommended, as various information about the server is cached
- * after the first request (to optimize subsequent requests) and persistent
- * connections are used whenever possible. <P>
- *
- * To POST form data you would use something like this (assuming you have two
- * fields called <var>name</var> and <var>e-mail</var> , whose contents are
- * stored in the variables <var>name</var> and <var>email</var> ): <PRE>
- *     try
- *     {
- *         NVPair form_data[] = new NVPair[2];
- *         form_data[0] = new NVPair("name", name);
- *         form_data[1] = new NVPair("e-mail", email);
- *
- *         HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
- *         HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Post("/cgi-bin/my_script", form_data);
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             stream = rsp.getInputStream();
- *     }
- *     catch (IOException ioe)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println(ioe.toString());
- *     }
- *     catch (ModuleException me)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
- *     }
- * </PRE> Here the response data is read at leasure via an <var>InputStream
- * </var> instead of all at once into a <var>byte[]</var> . <P>
- *
- * As another example, if you have a URL you're trying to send a request to you
- * would do something like the following: <PRE>
- *     try
- *     {
- *         URL url = new URL("http://www.mydomain.us/test/my_file");
- *         HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(url);
- *         HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Put(url.getFile(), "Hello World");
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             text = rsp.getText();
- *     }
- *     catch (IOException ioe)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println(ioe.toString());
- *     }
- *     catch (ModuleException me)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
- *     }
- * </PRE> <P>
- *
- * There are a whole number of methods for each request type; however the
- * general forms are ([...] means that the enclosed is optional):
- * <ul>
- *   <li> Head ( file [, form-data [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Head ( file [, query [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Get ( file [, form-data [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Get ( file [, query [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Post ( file [, form-data [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Post ( file [, data [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Post ( file [, stream [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Put ( file , data [, headers ] )
- *   <li> Put ( file , stream [, headers ] )
- *   <li> Delete ( file [, headers ] )
- *   <li> Options ( file [, headers [, data] ] )

-This directory contains a patch to the HTTPClient which adds a maximum bytes
-attribute to the getData() method. This method retrieves a file at once but
-would crash the server if the remote file was too large. 
-
-To compile it, download HTTPClient.jar from http://www.innovation.ch, extract it,
-overwrite the source files with the ones in this folder, and compile it.
-
-The file ../HTTPClient-0.3.3-patched.jar already contains a patched version

-/**
- * This class implements http protocol requests; it contains most of HTTP/1.1
- * and ought to be unconditionally compliant. Redirections are automatically
- * handled, and authorizations requests are recognized and dealt with via an
- * authorization handler. Only full HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 requests are
- * generated. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/0.9 responses are recognized. <P>
- *
- * Using the HTTPClient should be quite simple. First add the import statement '
- * <code>import HTTPClient.*;</code>' to your file(s). Request can then be sent
- * using one of the methods <var>Head()</var> , <var>Get()</var> , <var>Post()
- * </var>, etc in <var>HTTPConnection</var> . These methods all return an
- * instance of <var>HTTPResponse</var> which has methods for accessing the
- * response headers (<var>getHeader()</var> , <var>getHeaderAsInt()</var> ,
- * etc), various response info (<var>getStatusCode()</var> , <var>
- * getReasonLine()</var> , etc) and the reponse data (<var>getData()</var> ,
- * <var>getText()</var> , and <var>getInputStream()</var> ). Following are some
- * examples. <P>
- *
- * If this is in an applet you can retrieve files from your server as follows:
- * <PRE>
- *     try
- *     {
- *         HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
- *         HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Get("/my_file");
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             data = rsp.getData();
- *
- *         rsp = con.Get("/another_file");
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             other_data = rsp.getData();
- *     }
- *     catch (IOException ioe)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println(ioe.toString());
- *     }
- *     catch (ModuleException me)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
- *     }
- * </PRE> This will get the files "/my_file" and "/another_file" and put their
- * contents into byte[]'s accessible via <code>getData()</code>. Note that you
- * need to only create a new <var>HTTPConnection</var> when sending a request to
- * a new server (different host or port); although you may create a new <var>
- * HTTPConnection</var> for every request to the same server this <strong>not
- * </strong> recommended, as various information about the server is cached
- * after the first request (to optimize subsequent requests) and persistent
- * connections are used whenever possible. <P>
- *
- * To POST form data you would use something like this (assuming you have two
- * fields called <var>name</var> and <var>e-mail</var> , whose contents are
- * stored in the variables <var>name</var> and <var>email</var> ): <PRE>
- *     try
- *     {
- *         NVPair form_data[] = new NVPair[2];
- *         form_data[0] = new NVPair("name", name);
- *         form_data[1] = new NVPair("e-mail", email);
- *
- *         HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
- *         HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Post("/cgi-bin/my_script", form_data);
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             stream = rsp.getInputStream();
- *     }
- *     catch (IOException ioe)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println(ioe.toString());
- *     }
- *     catch (ModuleException me)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
- *     }
- * </PRE> Here the response data is read at leasure via an <var>InputStream
- * </var> instead of all at once into a <var>byte[]</var> . <P>
- *
- * As another example, if you have a URL you're trying to send a request to you
- * would do something like the following: <PRE>
- *     try
- *     {
- *         URL url = new URL("http://www.mydomain.us/test/my_file");
- *         HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(url);
- *         HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Put(url.getFile(), "Hello World");
- *         if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
- *         {
- *             System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
- *             System.err.println(rsp.getText());
- *         }
- *         else
- *             text = rsp.getText();
- *     }
- *     catch (IOException ioe)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println(ioe.toString());
- *     }
- *     catch (ModuleException me)
- *     {
- *         System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
- *     }
- * </PRE> <P>
- *
- * There are a whole number of methods for each request type; however the
- * general forms are ([...] means that the enclosed is optional):
- * <ul>
- *   <li> Head ( file [, form-data [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Head ( file [, query [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Get ( file [, form-data [, headers ] ] )
- *   <li> Get ( file [, query [, headers ] ] )

-ucene 1.2 has become an increasingly popular library for incorporating search functionality into Java applications. As it stands, the Lucene codebase is an API, as opposed to a search framework, or a full-fledged search application. The consequence is tha
-t developers (users of the API) often need to implement commonly-used but non-API functionality, in addition to any custom search requirements, to arrive at a working search application.
-\par 
-\par This proposal is a plan to leverage existing contributions and integr
-ate them into a Lucene search framework. We believe it will significantly reduce the time taken to implement a searching and indexing solution using Lucene, provide deeper functionality for a basic application and lower the time it takes for a new user to
- be productive. It will also constitute a best-practice model of how the Lucene user community creates efficient, flexible search applications, by means of the framework.
-\par 
-\par This framework is a foundation of what we call the Lucene Retrieval Machine (LARM). I
-n contrast to the framework, the retrieval machine forms an application that can be installed and used by an end user. We think that the framework can be so modular that LARM can in fact form many different applications, from indexing database tables to f
-ile systems, up to indexing a large portion of the web. Many of these configurations can come out-of-the box.
-\par 
-\par To take a familiar example, the Apache Web Server provides a framework for pluggable modules (the Apache modules) that allow for easily extending 
-the web server using standard interfaces. On the other hand it is also easily configurable by an end user, and can be used without further programming. We want LARM to be even more flexible, to consist of merely a microkernel and consisting mainly of plug
-gable components.

- an existing index, wraps them in a Request Container, and puts them in the Request Queue of the Gatherer (or Fetcher, same thing, lets pick one name).\~
- We could also provide an interface where a user can manually add Request Containers into the Request Queue.\~ We could also have an implementation of Scheduler that looks at some external locations for documents to index\line

- I am not sure what would be hosting it, whether it would be a Servlet container (e.g. SearchBean would be called from a servlet, like it probably is currently in most places that use it), or
- whether it would be Avalon (how do we serve HTTP requests by a component that runs under Avalon?\~ Apples and oranges?). I don\rquote t think we worry about this we just provide an interface.

-In this example a crawler forms the \'93gatherer\'94 part. Process (A) receives a list of URLs as input and outputs a list of (filtered) URLs that represent \'93crawling requests\'94 for the crawler. In 
-process (B) the documents are loaded and then transferred to a process (C) in which links are extracted from the documents and put back into the crawler, and which puts the documents into a Lucene index. It is important to note that 
-the requests in (1) and (2) may not only consist of URLs but also of extra info. In incremental operation for example each request may contain a date for each doc. The crawler in (B) may load the HTTP header and stop reading the file if the date hasn

-\par Messages transferred in (1) to (3) will usually be a collection of data units, e.g. 100 URLs or 10 documents. A dispatcher may be used to put groups of messages together, based on time or volume thresholds.

-s based on a set of components that provide complete data aggregation and indexing functionality. The integration of these various components provide an ease of use for extracting data from various data source and indexing the information. 
-\par The Lucene Fram
-ework creates the ability to take data from different data sources including web pages, databases, and file systems, and put them into a Lucene index. Optionally, take the data from the data source at a unit level (a web pages, a row or a file) and store 
-that into a file in a standard format for later display.
-\par For the Web pages, the framework includes a complete crawler with the ability to provide a link handling strategy that indicates how to handle embedded links within the web pages.
-\par 
-\par The pipeline framework is a set of classes that allows for a separation of different \'93assembly\'94 parts of the whole system. That way different parts of the pipeline can be put in different classes and can be developed rather independently. 
-\par It\rquote s an in-proce
-ss framework (compared to message queue systems which are mostly used for interprocess communications) and very low level: If it is known that only thread is involved, the components need not even be thread safe. The aim is to be able to process a very la

-A MessageProcessor (MP) is called by a pipeline to handle a message. It may alter the message, filter it, save it somewhere, etc. It either returns null (forming a message sink) or it returns the messa
-ge (most of the time the same message it got, but it may also return a different one). Examples of an MP would be a RobotExclusionFilter (filtering some of the URLs from the URL list), a PDF to XML converter (reducing PDF to a common metaformat that is un

-erstood by the indexing component), a FileSystemStorage that saves incoming documents on disk, a JMSStorage that saves them to a message queue, or a LuceneStorage that adds a document to a Lucene index. An MP could as well contain a BlockingPipeline (see 
-below) forming a nested pipeline.
-\par [Is the storage a required part of the pipeline? If so I think we should break it up into more distinct pieces to there can be some control programmatically. If not is there a required order?]

-A NonBlockingPipeline has an extra thread that handles the messages. Therefore, at a putMessage() call, the message is written into a message queue. The processor thread handles all messages until the queue is empty. Internally the AsynchronousProcessor c
-onsists of a BlockingPipeline that is operated by the ProcessorThread.
-\par In that scenario, an MP may create new messages and put them back into the same queue without causing the queue to block.
-\par 
-\par The Queue implementation will usually be a FIFO queue, but may be exchanged depending on the needs. A queue may refuse a message (i.e. if it is full).

-vice call) such that a broader view may reveal that the source only forms a part of a larger assembly line. This can be compared to a car manufacturer that gets car parts from other manufacturers who also have assembly lines.

-In a queue where document objects are passed through the pipeline, a set of processing steps may be taken on the documents, depending on their types. That way a heterogeneous mass of documents (PDF, HTML, Word
- etc.) is transformed to Document objects consisting of name/value pairs with index terms for the search engine. Keeping this in a message pipeline (and not i.e. in a set of nested iterators that transform the documents on the fly) makes sure that this pi

-. It may consist of only one pipeline.
-\par The Scheduler puts document locations (i.e. file URLs) in an asynchronous (Request-) pipeline. The first MP loads the document, replacing the file URL message by a document message, and tries to detec
-t a MIME type. After that, the MessageDispatcher component dispatches the messages to different MPs, depending on the MIME type, that extract the text of each document. In the end, a LuceneStorage takes the resulting message and saves it in a Lucene index
-.
-\par In an extension of that one MP first detects the Mime type, a second would check if that mime type can be handled by the application, the third then loads the doc, the fourth analyses the documents and the sixth saves them to a LuceneStorage.
-\par In an incremental operation the Source is connected to the LuceneStorage and checks if documents have to be refreshed. An additional MP may check if the document loaded is newer than the one already indexed, and may discard the message if not.

-e
-Pipelines, since the crawling parts are again active components. An additional processing step extracts links from the loaded documents and puts them back into the queue. A URLSeenFilter (called URLVisitedFilter at this time) makes sure no URL is put into
- the pipeline twice. A  RobotExclusionFilter makes sure the robot exclusion standard is followed, and filters URLs that are marked to be \'93disallowed\'94. At the end there is again that LuceneStorage.

-If the system is supposed to scale to more than a few hosts, memory, efficiency and fault tolerance becomes a major concern, and it more and more becomes a matter 
-of juggling with the system resources (network bandwidth, CPU time, RAM, hard drive space). If one of them becomes a bottleneck, the whole system may become very slow or (in case of RAM or HD shortage) may crash.
-\par Suppose LuceneStorage is much slower than t
-he crawler. Since the indexer is pretty much CPU bound it becomes necessary to distribute that on to two hosts. This can be done easily with the pipeline framework if it the pipeline is broken up into two parts and connected via JMS. The loaded document i
-s
- put into a JMS topic which is configured such that the JMS messages are routed to one of the destinations in a round-robin manner. On the other side there are indexing components on different hosts that build Lucene indexes that are merged from time to t
-ime.

-A database indexer may consist of a Message source that is connected to the messaging mechanism of the database (i.e. triggers). It then reads the contents of changed database fields and puts them alon
-g to the indexer. That way Lucene may be integrated into HSSQL or even Oracle.
