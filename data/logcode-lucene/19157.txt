@@ -4,6 +4,12 @@ This project provides pre-compiled version of the Snowball stemmers
 based on revision 500 of the Tartarus Snowball repository,
 together with classes integrating them with the Lucene search engine.
 
+A few changes has been made to the static Snowball code and compiled stemmers:
+
+ * Class SnowballProgram is made abstract and contains new abstract method stem() to avoid reflection in Lucene filter class SnowballFilter.
+ * All use of StringBuffers has been refactored to StringBuilder for speed.
+ * Snowball BSD license header has been added to the Java classes to avoid having RAT adding new ASL headers.
+
 
 IMPORTANT NOTICE ON BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!
