+ * <h2>Benchmarking By Tasks</h2>
+ * <p>
+ * Benchmark Lucene using task primitives.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * A benchmark is composed of some predefined tasks, allowing for creating an
+ * index, adding documents,
+ * optimizing, searching, generating reports, and more. A benchmark run takes an
+ * "algorithm" file
+ * that contains a description of the sequence of tasks making up the run, and some
+ * properties defining a few
+ * additional characteristics of the benchmark run.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <a name="usage"></a>
+ * <h2>How to use</h2>
+ * <p>
+ * Easiest way to run a benchmarks is using the predefined ant task:
+ * <ul>
+ *  <li>ant run-task
+ *      <br>- would run the <code>micro-standard.alg</code> "algorithm".
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>ant run-task -Dtask.alg=conf/compound-penalty.alg
+ *      <br>- would run the <code>compound-penalty.alg</code> "algorithm".
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>ant run-task -Dtask.alg=[full-path-to-your-alg-file]
+ *      <br>- would run <code>your perf test</code> "algorithm".
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>java org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.programmatic.Sample
+ *      <br>- would run a performance test programmatically - without using an alg
+ *      file. This is less readable, and less convenient, but possible.
+ *  </li>
+ * </ul>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * You may find existing tasks sufficient for defining the benchmark <i>you</i>
+ * need, otherwise, you can extend the framework to meet your needs, as explained
+ * herein.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Each benchmark run has a DocMaker and a QueryMaker. These two should usually
+ * match, so that "meaningful" queries are used for a certain collection.
+ * Properties set at the header of the alg file define which "makers" should be
+ * used. You can also specify your own makers, extending DocMaker and implementing
+ * QueryMaker.
+ *   <blockquote>
+ *     <b>Note:</b> since 2.9, DocMaker is a concrete class which accepts a 
+ *     ContentSource. In most cases, you can use the DocMaker class to create 
+ *     Documents, while providing your own ContentSource implementation. For 
+ *     example, the current Benchmark package includes ContentSource 
+ *     implementations for TREC, Enwiki and Reuters collections, as well as 
+ *     others like LineDocSource which reads a 'line' file produced by 
+ *     WriteLineDocTask.
+ *   </blockquote>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Benchmark .alg file contains the benchmark "algorithm". The syntax is described
+ * below. Within the algorithm, you can specify groups of commands, assign them
+ * names, specify commands that should be repeated,
+ * do commands in serial or in parallel,
+ * and also control the speed of "firing" the commands.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * This allows, for instance, to specify
+ * that an index should be opened for update,
+ * documents should be added to it one by one but not faster than 20 docs a minute,
+ * and, in parallel with this,
+ * some N queries should be searched against that index,
+ * again, no more than 2 queries a second.
+ * You can have the searches all share an index reader,
+ * or have them each open its own reader and close it afterwords.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * If the commands available for use in the algorithm do not meet your needs,
+ * you can add commands by adding a new task under
+ * org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks -
+ * you should extend the PerfTask abstract class.
+ * Make sure that your new task class name is suffixed by Task.
+ * Assume you added the class "WonderfulTask" - doing so also enables the
+ * command "Wonderful" to be used in the algorithm.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * <u>External classes</u>: It is sometimes useful to invoke the benchmark
+ * package with your external alg file that configures the use of your own
+ * doc/query maker and or html parser. You can work this out without
+ * modifying the benchmark package code, by passing your class path
+ * with the benchmark.ext.classpath property:
+ * <ul>
+ *   <li>ant run-task -Dtask.alg=[full-path-to-your-alg-file]
+ *       <span style="color: #FF0000">-Dbenchmark.ext.classpath=/mydir/classes
+ *       </span> -Dtask.mem=512M</li>
+ * </ul>
+ * <p>
+ * <u>External tasks</u>: When writing your own tasks under a package other than 
+ * <b>org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks</b> specify that package thru the
+ * <span style="color: #FF0000">alt.tasks.packages</span> property.
+ * 
+ * <a name="algorithm"></a>
+ * <h2>Benchmark "algorithm"</h2>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * The following is an informal description of the supported syntax.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <ol>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Measuring</b>: When a command is executed, statistics for the elapsed
+ *  execution time and memory consumption are collected.
+ *  At any time, those statistics can be printed, using one of the
+ *  available ReportTasks.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Comments</b> start with '<span style="color: #FF0066">#</span>'.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Serial</b> sequences are enclosed within '<span style="color: #FF0066">{ }</span>'.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Parallel</b> sequences are enclosed within
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">[ ]</span>'
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Sequence naming:</b> To name a sequence, put
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">"name"</span>' just after
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">{</span>' or '<span style="color: #FF0066">[</span>'.
+ *  <br>Example - <span style="color: #FF0066">{ "ManyAdds" AddDoc } : 1000000</span> -
+ *  would
+ *  name the sequence of 1M add docs "ManyAdds", and this name would later appear
+ *  in statistic reports.
+ *  If you don't specify a name for a sequence, it is given one: you can see it as
+ *  the  algorithm is printed just before benchmark execution starts.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Repeating</b>:
+ *  To repeat sequence tasks N times, add '<span style="color: #FF0066">: N</span>' just
+ *  after the
+ *  sequence closing tag - '<span style="color: #FF0066">}</span>' or
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">]</span>' or '<span style="color: #FF0066">&gt;</span>'.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">[ AddDoc ] : 4</span>  - would do 4 addDoc
+ *  in parallel, spawning 4 threads at once.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">[ AddDoc AddDoc ] : 4</span>  - would do
+ *  8 addDoc in parallel, spawning 8 threads at once.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">{ AddDoc } : 30</span> - would do addDoc
+ *  30 times in a row.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">{ AddDoc AddDoc } : 30</span> - would do
+ *  addDoc 60 times in a row.
+ *  <br><b>Exhaustive repeating</b>: use <span style="color: #FF0066">*</span> instead of
+ *  a number to repeat exhaustively.
+ *  This is sometimes useful, for adding as many files as a doc maker can create,
+ *  without iterating over the same file again, especially when the exact
+ *  number of documents is not known in advance. For instance, TREC files extracted
+ *  from a zip file. Note: when using this, you must also set
+ *  <span style="color: #FF0066">content.source.forever</span> to false.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">{ AddDoc } : *</span>  - would add docs
+ *  until the doc maker is "exhausted".
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Command parameter</b>: a command can optionally take a single parameter.
+ *  If the certain command does not support a parameter, or if the parameter is of
+ *  the wrong type,
+ *  reading the algorithm will fail with an exception and the test would not start.
+ *  Currently the following tasks take optional parameters:
+ *  <ul>
+ *    <li><b>AddDoc</b> takes a numeric parameter, indicating the required size of
+ *        added document. Note: if the DocMaker implementation used in the test
+ *        does not support makeDoc(size), an exception would be thrown and the test
+ *        would fail.
+ *    </li>
+ *    <li><b>DeleteDoc</b> takes numeric parameter, indicating the docid to be
+ *        deleted. The latter is not very useful for loops, since the docid is
+ *        fixed, so for deletion in loops it is better to use the
+ *        <code>doc.delete.step</code> property.
+ *    </li>
+ *    <li><b>SetProp</b> takes a <code>name,value</code> mandatory param,
+ *        ',' used as a separator.
+ *    </li>
+ *    <li><b>SearchTravRetTask</b> and <b>SearchTravTask</b> take a numeric
+ *               parameter, indicating the required traversal size.
+ *    </li>
+ *    <li><b>SearchTravRetLoadFieldSelectorTask</b> takes a string
+ *               parameter: a comma separated list of Fields to load.
+ *    </li>
+ *    <li><b>SearchTravRetHighlighterTask</b> takes a string
+ *               parameter: a comma separated list of parameters to define highlighting.  See that
+ *      tasks javadocs for more information
+ *    </li>
+ *  </ul>
+ *  <br>Example - <span style="color: #FF0066">AddDoc(2000)</span> - would add a document
+ *  of size 2000 (~bytes).
+ *  <br>See conf/task-sample.alg for how this can be used, for instance, to check
+ *  which is faster, adding
+ *  many smaller documents, or few larger documents.
+ *  Next candidates for supporting a parameter may be the Search tasks,
+ *  for controlling the query size.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Statistic recording elimination</b>: - a sequence can also end with
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">&gt;</span>',
+ *  in which case child tasks would not store their statistics.
+ *  This can be useful to avoid exploding stats data, for adding say 1M docs.
+ *  <br>Example - <span style="color: #FF0066">{ "ManyAdds" AddDoc &gt; : 1000000</span> -
+ *  would add million docs, measure that total, but not save stats for each addDoc.
+ *  <br>Notice that the granularity of System.currentTimeMillis() (which is used
+ *  here) is system dependant,
+ *  and in some systems an operation that takes 5 ms to complete may show 0 ms
+ *  latency time in performance measurements.
+ *  Therefore it is sometimes more accurate to look at the elapsed time of a larger
+ *  sequence, as demonstrated here.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Rate</b>:
+ *  To set a rate (ops/sec or ops/min) for a sequence, add
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">: N : R</span>' just after sequence closing tag.
+ *  This would specify repetition of N with rate of R operations/sec.
+ *  Use '<span style="color: #FF0066">R/sec</span>' or
+ *  '<span style="color: #FF0066">R/min</span>'
+ *  to explicitly specify that the rate is per second or per minute.
+ *  The default is per second,
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">[ AddDoc ] : 400 : 3</span> - would do 400
+ *  addDoc in parallel, starting up to 3 threads per second.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066">{ AddDoc } : 100 : 200/min</span> - would
+ *  do 100 addDoc serially,
+ *  waiting before starting next add, if otherwise rate would exceed 200 adds/min.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Disable Counting</b>: Each task executed contributes to the records count.
+ *  This count is reflected in reports under recs/s and under recsPerRun.
+ *  Most tasks count 1, some count 0, and some count more.
+ *  (See <a href="#recsCounting">Results record counting clarified</a> for more details.)
+ *  It is possible to disable counting for a task by preceding it with <span style="color: #FF0066">-</span>.
+ *  <br>Example -  <span style="color: #FF0066"> -CreateIndex </span> - would count 0 while
+ *  the default behavior for CreateIndex is to count 1.
+ *  </li>
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Command names</b>: Each class "AnyNameTask" in the
+ *  package org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks,
+ *  that extends PerfTask, is supported as command "AnyName" that can be
+ *  used in the benchmark "algorithm" description.
+ *  This allows to add new commands by just adding such classes.
+ *  </li>
+ * </ol>
+ * 
+ * 
+ * <a name="tasks"></a>
+ * <h2>Supported tasks/commands</h2>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Existing tasks can be divided into a few groups:
+ * regular index/search work tasks, report tasks, and control tasks.
+ * </p>
+ * 
+ * <ol>
+ * 
+ *  <li>
+ *  <b>Report tasks</b>: There are a few Report commands for generating reports.
+ *  Only task runs that were completed are reported.
+ *  (The 'Report tasks' themselves are not measured and not reported.)
+ *  <ul>
+ *              <li>
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">RepAll</span> - all (completed) task runs.
+ *             </li>
+ *             <li>
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSumByName</span> - all statistics,
+ *             aggregated by name. So, if AddDoc was executed 2000 times,
+ *             only 1 report line would be created for it, aggregating all those
+ *             2000 statistic records.
+ *             </li>
+ *             <li>
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSelectByPref &nbsp; prefixWord</span> - all
+ *             records for tasks whose name start with
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">prefixWord</span>.
+ *             </li>
+ *             <li>
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSumByPref &nbsp; prefixWord</span> - all
+ *             records for tasks whose name start with
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">prefixWord</span>,
+ *             aggregated by their full task name.
+ *             </li>
+ *             <li>
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSumByNameRound</span> - all statistics,
+ *             aggregated by name and by <span style="color: #FF0066">Round</span>.
+ *             So, if AddDoc was executed 2000 times in each of 3
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">rounds</span>, 3 report lines would be
+ *             created for it,
+ *             aggregating all those 2000 statistic records in each round.
+ *             See more about rounds in the <span style="color: #FF0066">NewRound</span>
+ *             command description below.
+ *             </li>
+ *             <li>
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSumByPrefRound &nbsp; prefixWord</span> -
+ *             similar to <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSumByNameRound</span>,
+ *             just that only tasks whose name starts with
+ *             <span style="color: #FF0066">prefixWord</span> are included.
+ *             </li>
+ *  </ul>
+ *  If needed, additional reports can be added by extending the abstract class
+ *  ReportTask, and by
+ *  manipulating the statistics data in Points and TaskStats.
+ *  </li>
+ * 
+ *  <li><b>Control tasks</b>: Few of the tasks control the benchmark algorithm
+ *  all over:
+ *  <ul>
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">ClearStats</span> - clears the entire statistics.
+ *      Further reports would only include task runs that would start after this
+ *      call.
+ *      </li>
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">NewRound</span> - virtually start a new round of
+ *      performance test.
+ *      Although this command can be placed anywhere, it mostly makes sense at
+ *      the end of an outermost sequence.
+ *      <br>This increments a global "round counter". All task runs that
+ *      would start now would
+ *      record the new, updated round counter as their round number.
+ *      This would appear in reports.
+ *      In particular, see <span style="color: #FF0066">RepSumByNameRound</span> above.
+ *      <br>An additional effect of NewRound, is that numeric and boolean
+ *      properties defined (at the head
+ *      of the .alg file) as a sequence of values, e.g. <span style="color: #FF0066">
+ *      merge.factor=mrg:10:100:10:100</span> would
+ *      increment (cyclic) to the next value.
+ *      Note: this would also be reflected in the reports, in this case under a
+ *      column that would be named "mrg".
+ *      </li>
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">ResetInputs</span> - DocMaker and the
+ *      various QueryMakers
+ *      would reset their counters to start.
+ *      The way these Maker interfaces work, each call for makeDocument()
+ *      or makeQuery() creates the next document or query
+ *      that it "knows" to create.
+ *      If that pool is "exhausted", the "maker" start over again.
+ *      The ResetInputs command
+ *      therefore allows to make the rounds comparable.
+ *      It is therefore useful to invoke ResetInputs together with NewRound.
+ *      </li>
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">ResetSystemErase</span> - reset all index
+ *      and input data and call gc.
+ *      Does NOT reset statistics. This contains ResetInputs.
+ *      All writers/readers are nullified, deleted, closed.
+ *      Index is erased.
+ *      Directory is erased.
+ *      You would have to call CreateIndex once this was called...
+ *      </li>
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">ResetSystemSoft</span> -  reset all
+ *      index and input data and call gc.
+ *      Does NOT reset statistics. This contains ResetInputs.
+ *      All writers/readers are nullified, closed.
+ *      Index is NOT erased.
+ *      Directory is NOT erased.
+ *      This is useful for testing performance on an existing index,
+ *      for instance if the construction of a large index
+ *      took a very long time and now you would to test
+ *      its search or update performance.
+ *      </li>
+ *  </ul>
+ *  </li>
+ * 
+ *  <li>
+ *  Other existing tasks are quite straightforward and would
+ *  just be briefly described here.
+ *  <ul>
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">CreateIndex</span> and
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">OpenIndex</span> both leave the
+ *      index open for later update operations.
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">CloseIndex</span> would close it.
+ *      <li>
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">OpenReader</span>, similarly, would
+ *      leave an index reader open for later search operations.
+ *      But this have further semantics.
+ *      If a Read operation is performed, and an open reader exists,
+ *      it would be used.
+ *      Otherwise, the read operation would open its own reader
+ *      and close it when the read operation is done.
+ *      This allows testing various scenarios - sharing a reader,
+ *      searching with "cold" reader, with "warmed" reader, etc.
+ *      The read operations affected by this are:
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">Warm</span>,
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">Search</span>,
+ *      <span style="color: #FF0066">SearchTrav</span> (search and traverse),
+ *      and <span style="color: #FF0066">SearchTravRet</span> (search
+ *      and traverse and retrieve).
+ *      Notice that each of the 3 search task types maintains
+ *      its own queryMaker instance.
+ *    <li>
+ *    <span style="color: #FF0066">CommitIndex</span> and 
+ *    <span style="color: #FF0066">ForceMerge</span> can be used to commit
+ *    changes to the index then merge the index segments. The integer
+ *    parameter specifies how many segments to merge down to (default
+ *    1).
+ *    <li>
+ *    <span style="color: #FF0066">WriteLineDoc</span> prepares a 'line'
+ *    file where each line holds a document with <i>title</i>, 
+ *    <i>date</i> and <i>body</i> elements, separated by [TAB].
+ *    A line file is useful if one wants to measure pure indexing
+ *    performance, without the overhead of parsing the data.<br>
+ *    You can use LineDocSource as a ContentSource over a 'line'
+ *    file.
+ *    <li>
+ *    <span style="color: #FF0066">ConsumeContentSource</span> consumes
+ *    a ContentSource. Useful for e.g. testing a ContentSource
+ *    performance, without the overhead of preparing a Document
+ *    out of it.
+ *  </ul>
+ *  </li>

+ * define several parameters of the performance test.
+ * As mentioned above for the <span style="color: #FF0066">NewRound</span> task,
+ * numeric and boolean properties that are defined as a sequence
+ * of values, e.g. <span style="color: #FF0066">merge.factor=mrg:10:100:10:100</span>

+ * <p>
+ * Two columns in the results table indicate records counts: records-per-run and

+ * </p><p>
+ * Almost every task gets 1 in this count just for being executed.
+ * Task sequences aggregate the counts of their child tasks,
+ * plus their own count of 1.
+ * So, a task sequence containing 5 other task sequences, each running a single
+ * other task 10 times, would have a count of 1 + 5 * (1 + 10) = 56.
+ * </p><p>
+ * The traverse and retrieve tasks "count" more: a traverse task
+ * would add 1 for each traversed result (hit), and a retrieve task would
+ * additionally add 1 for each retrieved doc. So, regular Search would
+ * count 1, SearchTrav that traverses 10 hits would count 11, and a
+ * SearchTravRet task that retrieves (and traverses) 10, would count 21.
+ * </p><p>
+ * Confusing? this might help: always examine the <code>elapsedSec</code> column,
+ * and always compare "apples to apples", .i.e. it is interesting to check how the
+ * <code>rec/s</code> changed for the same task (or sequence) between two
+ * different runs, but it is not very useful to know how the <code>rec/s</code>
+ * differs between <code>Search</code> and <code>SearchTrav</code> tasks. For
+ * the latter, <code>elapsedSec</code> would bring more insight.

-<h2>Benchmarking By Tasks</h2>
-<p>
-Benchmark Lucene using task primitives.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-A benchmark is composed of some predefined tasks, allowing for creating an
-index, adding documents,
-optimizing, searching, generating reports, and more. A benchmark run takes an
-"algorithm" file
-that contains a description of the sequence of tasks making up the run, and some
-properties defining a few
-additional characteristics of the benchmark run.
-</p>
-
-<a name="usage"></a>
-<h2>How to use</h2>
-<p>
-Easiest way to run a benchmarks is using the predefined ant task:
-<ul>
- <li>ant run-task
-     <br>- would run the <code>micro-standard.alg</code> "algorithm".
- </li>
- <li>ant run-task -Dtask.alg=conf/compound-penalty.alg
-     <br>- would run the <code>compound-penalty.alg</code> "algorithm".
- </li>
- <li>ant run-task -Dtask.alg=[full-path-to-your-alg-file]
-     <br>- would run <code>your perf test</code> "algorithm".
- </li>
- <li>java org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.programmatic.Sample
-     <br>- would run a performance test programmatically - without using an alg
-     file. This is less readable, and less convenient, but possible.
- </li>
-</ul>
-</p>
-
-<p>
-You may find existing tasks sufficient for defining the benchmark <i>you</i>
-need, otherwise, you can extend the framework to meet your needs, as explained
-herein.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Each benchmark run has a DocMaker and a QueryMaker. These two should usually
-match, so that "meaningful" queries are used for a certain collection.
-Properties set at the header of the alg file define which "makers" should be
-used. You can also specify your own makers, extending DocMaker and implementing
-QueryMaker.
-	<blockquote>
-		<b>Note:</b> since 2.9, DocMaker is a concrete class which accepts a 
-		ContentSource. In most cases, you can use the DocMaker class to create 
-		Documents, while providing your own ContentSource implementation. For 
-		example, the current Benchmark package includes ContentSource 
-		implementations for TREC, Enwiki and Reuters collections, as well as 
-		others like LineDocSource which reads a 'line' file produced by 
-		WriteLineDocTask.
-	</blockquote>
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Benchmark .alg file contains the benchmark "algorithm". The syntax is described
-below. Within the algorithm, you can specify groups of commands, assign them
-names, specify commands that should be repeated,
-do commands in serial or in parallel,
-and also control the speed of "firing" the commands.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-This allows, for instance, to specify
-that an index should be opened for update,
-documents should be added to it one by one but not faster than 20 docs a minute,
-and, in parallel with this,
-some N queries should be searched against that index,
-again, no more than 2 queries a second.
-You can have the searches all share an index reader,
-or have them each open its own reader and close it afterwords.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-If the commands available for use in the algorithm do not meet your needs,
-you can add commands by adding a new task under
-org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks -
-you should extend the PerfTask abstract class.
-Make sure that your new task class name is suffixed by Task.
-Assume you added the class "WonderfulTask" - doing so also enables the
-command "Wonderful" to be used in the algorithm.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-<u>External classes</u>: It is sometimes useful to invoke the benchmark
-package with your external alg file that configures the use of your own
-doc/query maker and or html parser. You can work this out without
-modifying the benchmark package code, by passing your class path
-with the benchmark.ext.classpath property:
-<ul>
-  <li>ant run-task -Dtask.alg=[full-path-to-your-alg-file]
-      <font color="#FF0000">-Dbenchmark.ext.classpath=/mydir/classes
-      </font> -Dtask.mem=512M</li>
-</ul>
-<u>External tasks</u>: When writing your own tasks under a package other than 
-<b>org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks</b> specify that package thru the
-<font color="#FF0000">alt.tasks.packages</font> property.
-</p>
-
-<a name="algorithm"></a>
-<h2>Benchmark "algorithm"</h2>
-
-<p>
-The following is an informal description of the supported syntax.
-</p>
-
-<ol>
- <li>
- <b>Measuring</b>: When a command is executed, statistics for the elapsed
- execution time and memory consumption are collected.
- At any time, those statistics can be printed, using one of the
- available ReportTasks.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Comments</b> start with '<font color="#FF0066">#</font>'.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Serial</b> sequences are enclosed within '<font color="#FF0066">{ }</font>'.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Parallel</b> sequences are enclosed within
- '<font color="#FF0066">[ ]</font>'
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Sequence naming:</b> To name a sequence, put
- '<font color="#FF0066">"name"</font>' just after
- '<font color="#FF0066">{</font>' or '<font color="#FF0066">[</font>'.
- <br>Example - <font color="#FF0066">{ "ManyAdds" AddDoc } : 1000000</font> -
- would
- name the sequence of 1M add docs "ManyAdds", and this name would later appear
- in statistic reports.
- If you don't specify a name for a sequence, it is given one: you can see it as
- the  algorithm is printed just before benchmark execution starts.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Repeating</b>:
- To repeat sequence tasks N times, add '<font color="#FF0066">: N</font>' just
- after the
- sequence closing tag - '<font color="#FF0066">}</font>' or
- '<font color="#FF0066">]</font>' or '<font color="#FF0066">></font>'.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">[ AddDoc ] : 4</font>  - would do 4 addDoc
- in parallel, spawning 4 threads at once.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">[ AddDoc AddDoc ] : 4</font>  - would do
- 8 addDoc in parallel, spawning 8 threads at once.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">{ AddDoc } : 30</font> - would do addDoc
- 30 times in a row.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">{ AddDoc AddDoc } : 30</font> - would do
- addDoc 60 times in a row.
- <br><b>Exhaustive repeating</b>: use <font color="#FF0066">*</font> instead of
- a number to repeat exhaustively.
- This is sometimes useful, for adding as many files as a doc maker can create,
- without iterating over the same file again, especially when the exact
- number of documents is not known in advance. For instance, TREC files extracted
- from a zip file. Note: when using this, you must also set
- <font color="#FF0066">content.source.forever</font> to false.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">{ AddDoc } : *</font>  - would add docs
- until the doc maker is "exhausted".
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Command parameter</b>: a command can optionally take a single parameter.
- If the certain command does not support a parameter, or if the parameter is of
- the wrong type,
- reading the algorithm will fail with an exception and the test would not start.
- Currently the following tasks take optional parameters:
- <ul>
-   <li><b>AddDoc</b> takes a numeric parameter, indicating the required size of
-       added document. Note: if the DocMaker implementation used in the test
-       does not support makeDoc(size), an exception would be thrown and the test
-       would fail.
-   </li>
-   <li><b>DeleteDoc</b> takes numeric parameter, indicating the docid to be
-       deleted. The latter is not very useful for loops, since the docid is
-       fixed, so for deletion in loops it is better to use the
-       <code>doc.delete.step</code> property.
-   </li>
-   <li><b>SetProp</b> takes a <code>name,value</code> mandatory param,
-       ',' used as a separator.
-   </li>
-   <li><b>SearchTravRetTask</b> and <b>SearchTravTask</b> take a numeric
-              parameter, indicating the required traversal size.
-   </li>
-   <li><b>SearchTravRetLoadFieldSelectorTask</b> takes a string
-              parameter: a comma separated list of Fields to load.
-   </li>
-   <li><b>SearchTravRetHighlighterTask</b> takes a string
-              parameter: a comma separated list of parameters to define highlighting.  See that
-     tasks javadocs for more information
-   </li>
- </ul>
- <br>Example - <font color="#FF0066">AddDoc(2000)</font> - would add a document
- of size 2000 (~bytes).
- <br>See conf/task-sample.alg for how this can be used, for instance, to check
- which is faster, adding
- many smaller documents, or few larger documents.
- Next candidates for supporting a parameter may be the Search tasks,
- for controlling the query size.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Statistic recording elimination</b>: - a sequence can also end with
- '<font color="#FF0066">></font>',
- in which case child tasks would not store their statistics.
- This can be useful to avoid exploding stats data, for adding say 1M docs.
- <br>Example - <font color="#FF0066">{ "ManyAdds" AddDoc > : 1000000</font> -
- would add million docs, measure that total, but not save stats for each addDoc.
- <br>Notice that the granularity of System.currentTimeMillis() (which is used
- here) is system dependant,
- and in some systems an operation that takes 5 ms to complete may show 0 ms
- latency time in performance measurements.
- Therefore it is sometimes more accurate to look at the elapsed time of a larger
- sequence, as demonstrated here.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Rate</b>:
- To set a rate (ops/sec or ops/min) for a sequence, add
- '<font color="#FF0066">: N : R</font>' just after sequence closing tag.
- This would specify repetition of N with rate of R operations/sec.
- Use '<font color="#FF0066">R/sec</font>' or
- '<font color="#FF0066">R/min</font>'
- to explicitly specify that the rate is per second or per minute.
- The default is per second,
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">[ AddDoc ] : 400 : 3</font> - would do 400
- addDoc in parallel, starting up to 3 threads per second.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066">{ AddDoc } : 100 : 200/min</font> - would
- do 100 addDoc serially,
- waiting before starting next add, if otherwise rate would exceed 200 adds/min.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Disable Counting</b>: Each task executed contributes to the records count.
- This count is reflected in reports under recs/s and under recsPerRun.
- Most tasks count 1, some count 0, and some count more.
- (See <a href="#recsCounting">Results record counting clarified</a> for more details.)
- It is possible to disable counting for a task by preceding it with <font color="#FF0066">-</font>.
- <br>Example -  <font color="#FF0066"> -CreateIndex </font> - would count 0 while
- the default behavior for CreateIndex is to count 1.
- </li>
- <li>
- <b>Command names</b>: Each class "AnyNameTask" in the
- package org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.tasks,
- that extends PerfTask, is supported as command "AnyName" that can be
- used in the benchmark "algorithm" description.
- This allows to add new commands by just adding such classes.
- </li>
-</ol>

-
-<a name="tasks"></a>
-<h2>Supported tasks/commands</h2>
-
-<p>
-Existing tasks can be divided into a few groups:
-regular index/search work tasks, report tasks, and control tasks.
-</p>
-
-<ol>
-
- <li>
- <b>Report tasks</b>: There are a few Report commands for generating reports.
- Only task runs that were completed are reported.
- (The 'Report tasks' themselves are not measured and not reported.)
- <ul>
-             <li>
-            <font color="#FF0066">RepAll</font> - all (completed) task runs.
-            </li>
-            <li>
-            <font color="#FF0066">RepSumByName</font> - all statistics,
-            aggregated by name. So, if AddDoc was executed 2000 times,
-            only 1 report line would be created for it, aggregating all those
-            2000 statistic records.
-            </li>
-            <li>
-            <font color="#FF0066">RepSelectByPref &nbsp; prefixWord</font> - all
-            records for tasks whose name start with
-            <font color="#FF0066">prefixWord</font>.
-            </li>
-            <li>
-            <font color="#FF0066">RepSumByPref &nbsp; prefixWord</font> - all
-            records for tasks whose name start with
-            <font color="#FF0066">prefixWord</font>,
-            aggregated by their full task name.
-            </li>
-            <li>
-            <font color="#FF0066">RepSumByNameRound</font> - all statistics,
-            aggregated by name and by <font color="#FF0066">Round</font>.
-            So, if AddDoc was executed 2000 times in each of 3
-            <font color="#FF0066">rounds</font>, 3 report lines would be
-            created for it,
-            aggregating all those 2000 statistic records in each round.
-            See more about rounds in the <font color="#FF0066">NewRound</font>
-            command description below.
-            </li>
-            <li>
-            <font color="#FF0066">RepSumByPrefRound &nbsp; prefixWord</font> -
-            similar to <font color="#FF0066">RepSumByNameRound</font>,
-            just that only tasks whose name starts with
-            <font color="#FF0066">prefixWord</font> are included.
-            </li>
- </ul>
- If needed, additional reports can be added by extending the abstract class
- ReportTask, and by
- manipulating the statistics data in Points and TaskStats.
- </li>
-
- <li><b>Control tasks</b>: Few of the tasks control the benchmark algorithm
- all over:
- <ul>
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">ClearStats</font> - clears the entire statistics.
-     Further reports would only include task runs that would start after this
-     call.
-     </li>
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">NewRound</font> - virtually start a new round of
-     performance test.
-     Although this command can be placed anywhere, it mostly makes sense at
-     the end of an outermost sequence.
-     <br>This increments a global "round counter". All task runs that
-     would start now would
-     record the new, updated round counter as their round number.
-     This would appear in reports.
-     In particular, see <font color="#FF0066">RepSumByNameRound</font> above.
-     <br>An additional effect of NewRound, is that numeric and boolean
-     properties defined (at the head
-     of the .alg file) as a sequence of values, e.g. <font color="#FF0066">
-     merge.factor=mrg:10:100:10:100</font> would
-     increment (cyclic) to the next value.
-     Note: this would also be reflected in the reports, in this case under a
-     column that would be named "mrg".
-     </li>
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">ResetInputs</font> - DocMaker and the
-     various QueryMakers
-     would reset their counters to start.
-     The way these Maker interfaces work, each call for makeDocument()
-     or makeQuery() creates the next document or query
-     that it "knows" to create.
-     If that pool is "exhausted", the "maker" start over again.
-     The ResetInputs command
-     therefore allows to make the rounds comparable.
-     It is therefore useful to invoke ResetInputs together with NewRound.
-     </li>
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">ResetSystemErase</font> - reset all index
-     and input data and call gc.
-     Does NOT reset statistics. This contains ResetInputs.
-     All writers/readers are nullified, deleted, closed.
-     Index is erased.
-     Directory is erased.
-     You would have to call CreateIndex once this was called...
-     </li>
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">ResetSystemSoft</font> -  reset all
-     index and input data and call gc.
-     Does NOT reset statistics. This contains ResetInputs.
-     All writers/readers are nullified, closed.
-     Index is NOT erased.
-     Directory is NOT erased.
-     This is useful for testing performance on an existing index,
-     for instance if the construction of a large index
-     took a very long time and now you would to test
-     its search or update performance.
-     </li>
- </ul>
- </li>
-
- <li>
- Other existing tasks are quite straightforward and would
- just be briefly described here.
- <ul>
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">CreateIndex</font> and
-     <font color="#FF0066">OpenIndex</font> both leave the
-     index open for later update operations.
-     <font color="#FF0066">CloseIndex</font> would close it.
-     <li>
-     <font color="#FF0066">OpenReader</font>, similarly, would
-     leave an index reader open for later search operations.
-     But this have further semantics.
-     If a Read operation is performed, and an open reader exists,
-     it would be used.
-     Otherwise, the read operation would open its own reader
-     and close it when the read operation is done.
-     This allows testing various scenarios - sharing a reader,
-     searching with "cold" reader, with "warmed" reader, etc.
-     The read operations affected by this are:
-     <font color="#FF0066">Warm</font>,
-     <font color="#FF0066">Search</font>,
-     <font color="#FF0066">SearchTrav</font> (search and traverse),
-     and <font color="#FF0066">SearchTravRet</font> (search
-     and traverse and retrieve).
-     Notice that each of the 3 search task types maintains
-     its own queryMaker instance.
-	 <li>
-	 <font color="#FF0066">CommitIndex</font> and 
-	 <font color="#FF0066">ForceMerge</font> can be used to commit
-	 changes to the index then merge the index segments. The integer
-   parameter specifies how many segments to merge down to (default
-   1).
-	 <li>
-	 <font color="#FF0066">WriteLineDoc</font> prepares a 'line'
-	 file where each line holds a document with <i>title</i>, 
-	 <i>date</i> and <i>body</i> elements, separated by [TAB].
-	 A line file is useful if one wants to measure pure indexing
-	 performance, without the overhead of parsing the data.<br>
-	 You can use LineDocSource as a ContentSource over a 'line'
-	 file.
-	 <li>
-	 <font color="#FF0066">ConsumeContentSource</font> consumes
-	 a ContentSource. Useful for e.g. testing a ContentSource
-	 performance, without the overhead of preparing a Document
-	 out of it.
- </ul>
- </li>
- </ol>

-<h2>Benchmark properties</h2>
-
-<p>
-Properties are read from the header of the .alg file, and
-define several parameters of the performance test.
-As mentioned above for the <font color="#FF0066">NewRound</font> task,
-numeric and boolean properties that are defined as a sequence
-of values, e.g. <font color="#FF0066">merge.factor=mrg:10:100:10:100</font>
-would increment (cyclic) to the next value,
-when NewRound is called, and would also
-appear as a named column in the reports (column
-name would be "mrg" in this example).
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Some of the currently defined properties are:
-</p>
-
-<ol>
-    <li>
-    <font color="#FF0066">analyzer</font> - full
-    class name for the analyzer to use.
-    Same analyzer would be used in the entire test.
-    </li>
-
-    <li>
-    <font color="#FF0066">directory</font> - valid values are
-    This tells which directory to use for the performance test.
-    </li>
-
-    <li>
-    <b>Index work parameters</b>:
-    Multi int/boolean values would be iterated with calls to NewRound.
-    There would be also added as columns in the reports, first string in the
-    sequence is the column name.
-    (Make sure it is no shorter than any value in the sequence).
-    <ul>
-        <li><font color="#FF0066">max.buffered</font>
-        <br>Example: max.buffered=buf:10:10:100:100 -
-        this would define using maxBufferedDocs of 10 in iterations 0 and 1,
-        and 100 in iterations 2 and 3.
-        </li>
-        <li>
-        <font color="#FF0066">merge.factor</font> - which
-        merge factor to use.
-        </li>
-        <li>
-        <font color="#FF0066">compound</font> - whether the index is
-        using the compound format or not. Valid values are "true" and "false".

-<a name="recsCounting"></a>
-<h2>Results record counting clarified</h2>
-<p>
-Two columns in the results table indicate records counts: records-per-run and
-records-per-second. What does it mean?
-</p><p>
-Almost every task gets 1 in this count just for being executed.
-Task sequences aggregate the counts of their child tasks,
-plus their own count of 1.
-So, a task sequence containing 5 other task sequences, each running a single
-other task 10 times, would have a count of 1 + 5 * (1 + 10) = 56.
-</p><p>
-The traverse and retrieve tasks "count" more: a traverse task
-would add 1 for each traversed result (hit), and a retrieve task would
-additionally add 1 for each retrieved doc. So, regular Search would
-count 1, SearchTrav that traverses 10 hits would count 11, and a
-SearchTravRet task that retrieves (and traverses) 10, would count 21.
-</p><p>
-Confusing? this might help: always examine the <code>elapsedSec</code> column,
-and always compare "apples to apples", .i.e. it is interesting to check how the
-<code>rec/s</code> changed for the same task (or sequence) between two
-different runs, but it is not very useful to know how the <code>rec/s</code>
-differs between <code>Search</code> and <code>SearchTrav</code> tasks. For
-the latter, <code>elapsedSec</code> would bring more insight.

+ * <p>
+ * For benchmarking TREC collections with TREC QRels, take a look at the 
+ * {@link org.apache.lucene.benchmark.quality.trec trec package}.
