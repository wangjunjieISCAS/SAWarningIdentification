+# Solr-Powered File Search
+
+This README guides you through creating a Solr-powered search engine for your own set of files including Word documents,
+PDFs, HTML, and many other supported types. 
+
+For further explanations, see the frequently asked questions at the end of the guide.
+
+##GETTING STARTED
+
+* To start Solr, enter the following command (make sure you??e cd??d into the directory in which Solr was installed): 
+
+	bin/solr start 
+
+* If you??e started correctly, you should see the following output:
+	
+		Waiting to see Solr listening on port 8983 [/]  
+		Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=<your pid>). Happy searching!
+<hr>
+
+##CREATING THE CORE/COLLECTION
+
+* Before you can index your documents, you??l need to create a core/collection. Do this by entering:
+
+		bin/solr create -c files -d example/files/conf
+
+* Now you??e created a core called ??iles?? using a configuration tuned for indexing and query rich text files.
+
+* You should see the following response:
+
+		Creating new core 'files' using command:
+		http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=files&instanceDir=files
+
+		{
+			"responseHeader":{
+				"status":0,
+				"QTime":239},
+			"core":"files"}
+
+<hr>
+##INDEXING DOCUMENTS
+
+* Return to your command shell. To post all of your documents to the documents core, enter the following: 
+
+		bin/post -c files ~/Documents
+
+* Depending on how many documents you have, this could take a while. Sit back and watch the magic happen. When all of your documents have been indexed you??l see something like:
+
+		<some number> files indexed.
+		COMMITting Solr index changes to http://localhost:8983/solr/files/update...
+		Time spent: <some amount of time>
+
+<hr>
+##BROWSING DOCUMENTS
+
+* Your document information can be viewed in multiple formats: XML, JSON, CSV, as well as a nice HTML interface. 
+
+* To view your document information in the HTML interface view, adjust the URL in your address bar to [http://localhost:8983/solr/files/browse](http://localhost:8983/solr/files/browse)
+
+* To view your document information in XML or other formats, add &wt (for writer type) to the end of that URL. i.e.:
+	[http://localhost:8983/solr/files/browse?&wt=xml](http://localhost:8983/solr/files/browse?&wt=xml)
+
+<hr>
+##ADMIN UI
+
+* Another way to verify that your core has been created is to view it in the Admin User Interface.
+
+You can use the Admin_UI as a visual tool for most of the things you??l be doing with your cores/collections in Solr.
+
+* To access the Admin UI, go to your browser visit :
+	[http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/)
+
+	- <i>The Admin UI is only accessible when Solr is running</i>
+
+* On the left-hand side of the home page, click on ??ore Selector??. The core you created, called ??iles?? should be listed there; click on it. If it?? not listed, your core was not created and you??l need to re-enter the create command.
+* Alternatively, you could just go to the core page directly by visiting : [http://localhost:8983/solr/#/files](http://localhost:8983/solr/#/files)
+
+* Now you??e opened the core page. On this page there are a multitude of different tools you can use to analyze and search your core. You will make use of these features after indexing your documents.
+
+<hr>
+##QUERYING INDEX
+
+* In the Admin UI, enter a term in the query box to see which documents contain the word. 
+
+* You can filter the results by switching between the different content type tabs.
+
+* Notice the tag cloud on the right side, which facets by top phrases extracted during indexing.
+  Click on the phrases to see which documents contain them.
+
+* Another way to query the index is by manipulating the URL in your address bar once in the browse view.
+
+* i.e. : [http://localhost:8983/solr/files/browse?q=Lucene](http://localhost:8983/solr/files/browse?q=Lucene)
+<hr>
+##FAQs
+
+* Why use -d when creating a core?
+	* -d specifies a specific configuration to use.  This example as a configuration tuned for indexing and query rich
+	  text files.
+	
+* How do I delete a core?
+	* To delete a core (i.e. files), you can enter the following in your command shell:
+		bin/solr delete -c files
+
+	* You should see the following output:
+	
+		Deleting core 'files' using command:
+			http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=UNLOAD&core=files&deleteIndex=true&deleteDataDir=true&deleteInstanceDir=true
+    
+			{"responseHeader":{
+					"status":0,
+					"QTime":19}}
+
+	* This calls the Solr core admin handler, "UNLOAD", and the parameters "deleteDataDir" and "deleteInstanceDir" to ensure that all data associated with core is also removed
+
+* How can I change the /browse UI?
+
+	The primary templates are under example/files/conf/velocity.  In order to edit those files in place (without having to
+	re-create or patch a core/collection with an updated configuration), Solr can be started with a special system property
+	set to the _absolute_ path to the conf/velocity directory, like this:
+
+
+	 bin/solr start -Dvelocity.template.base.dir=</full/path/to>/example/files/conf/velocity/
+	
+	
 bin/solr stop
 rm -Rf server/solr/files/

+# This file defines a stopword set for Japanese.

+# This set is made up of hand-picked frequent terms from segmented Japanese Wikipedia.
+# Punctuation characters and frequent kanji have mostly been left out.  See LUCENE-3745
+# for frequency lists, etc. that can be useful for making your own set (if desired)
+#
+# Note that there is an overlap between these stopwords and the terms stopped when used
+# in combination with the JapanesePartOfSpeechStopFilter.  When editing this file, note
+# that comments are not allowed on the same line as stopwords.
+#
+# Also note that stopping is done in a case-insensitive manner.  Change your StopFilter
+# configuration if you need case-sensitive stopping.  Lastly, note that stopping is done
+# using the same character width as the entries in this file.  Since this StopFilter is
+# normally done after a CJKWidthFilter in your chain, you would usually want your romaji
+# entries to be in half-width and your kana entries to be in full-width.

+

+

+       analysis.fieldvalue - text for index-time analysis
+       q (or analysis.q) - text for query time analysis
+       analysis.showmatch (true|false) - When set to true and when
+           query analysis is performed, the produced tokens of the
+           field value analysis will be marked as "matched" for every

+  <!-- Document Analysis Handler
+
+       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/AnalysisRequestHandler
+
+       An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis
+       process of provided documents. This handler expects a (single)
+       content stream with the following format:
+
+       <docs>
+         <doc>
+           <field name="id">1</field>
+           <field name="name">The Name</field>

+         <doc>...</doc>
+         <doc>...</doc>
+         ...
+       </docs>
+
+    Note: Each document must contain a field which serves as the
+    unique key. This key is used in the returned response to associate
+    an analysis breakdown to the analyzed document.
+
+    Like the FieldAnalysisRequestHandler, this handler also supports
+    query analysis by sending either an "analysis.query" or "q"
+    request parameter that holds the query text to be analyzed. It
+    also supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to
+    true, all field tokens that match the query tokens will be marked
+    as a "match".
