-As we discussed in the previous walkthrough, the IndexFiles class creates a Lucene Index.

+As we discussed in the previous walk-through, the <code><a

+Index. Let's take a look at how it does this.
 </p>
+
 <p>
-The first substantial thing the main function does is instantiate an instance
-of IndexWriter.  It passes a string called "index" and a new instance of a class called
-"StandardAnalyzer".  The "index" string is the name of the directory that all index information
-should be stored in.  Because we're not passing any path information, one must assume this
-will be created as a subdirectory of the current directory (if it does not already exist). On
-some platforms this may actually result in it being created in other directories (such as 
-the user's home directory). 
+The first substantial thing the <code>main</code> function does is instantiate <code><a

+"<code>index</code>" and a new instance of a class called <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardAnalyzer.html">StandardAnalyzer</a></code>.
+The "<code>index</code>" string is the name of the filesystem directory where all index information
+should be stored.  Because we're not passing a full path, this will be created as a subdirectory of
+the current working directory (if it does not already exist). On some platforms, it may be created
+in other directories (such as the user's home directory).
 </p>
+
 <p>
-The <b>IndexWriter</b> is the main class responsible for creating indicies. To use it you
-must instantiate it with a path that it can write the index into, if this path does not 
-exist it will create it, otherwise it will refresh the index living at that path.  You 
-must a also pass an instance of <b>org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer</b>. 
+The <code><a href="api/org/apache/lucene/index/IndexWriter.html">IndexWriter</a></code> is the main
+class responsible for creating indices.  To use it you must instantiate it with a path that it can
+write the index into.  If this path does not exist it will first create it.  Otherwise it will
+refresh the index at that path.  You can also create an index using one of the subclasses of <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/store/Directory.html">Directory</a></code>.  In any case, you must also pass an
+instance of <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html">org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer</a></code>.
 </p>
+
 <p>
-The <b>Analyzer</b>, in this case, the <b>StandardAnalyzer</b> is little more than a standard Java
-Tokenizer, converting all strings to lowercase and filtering out useless words and characters from the index.
-By useless words and characters I mean common language words such as articles (a, an, the, etc.) and other 
-strings that would be useless for searching (e.g. <b>'s</b>) .  It should be noted that there are different 
-rules for every  language, and you should use the proper analyzer for each.  Lucene currently 
-provides Analyzers for English and German, more can be found in the Lucene Sandbox.
+The particular <code><a href="api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html">Analyzer</a></code> we
+are using, <code><a

+should use the proper analyzer for each.  Lucene currently provides Analyzers for a number of
+different languages (see the <code>*Analyzer.java</code> sources under <a

 </p>

 <p>
-Looking down further in the file, you should see the indexDocs() code.  This recursive function 
-simply crawls the directories and uses FileDocument to create Document objects.  The Document
-is simply a data object to represent the content in the file as well as its creation time and 
-location.  These instances are added to the indexWriter.  Take a look inside FileDocument.  It's
-not particularly complicated, it just adds fields to the Document.

 As you can see there isn't much to creating an index.  The devil is in the details.  You may also
-wish to examine the other samples in this directory, particularly the IndexHTML class.  It is 
-a bit more complex but builds upon this example.

-The SearchFiles class is quite simple.  It primarily collaborates with an IndexSearcher, StandardAnalyzer
-(which is used in the IndexFiles class as well) and a QueryParser.  The query parser is constructed
-with an analyzer used to interperate your query in the same way the Index was interperated: finding 
-the end of words and removing useless words like 'a', 'an' and 'the'.  The Query object contains the 
-results from the QueryParser which is passed to the searcher.  The searcher results are returned in 
-a collection of Documents called "Hits" which is then iterated through and displayed to the user.

-The header is also very simple by itself.  The only thing it does is include the configuration.jsp
-(which you looked at in the last section of this guide) and set the title and a brief header.  This
-would be a good place to put your own custom HTML to "pretty" things up a bit.  We won't cover the 
-footer because all it does is display the footer and close your tags.  Let's look at the results.jsp,

-The results.jsp had a lot more functionality.  Much of it is for paging the search results we'll not
-cover this as it's commented well enough.  It does not perform any optimizations such as caching results, 
-etc. as that would make this a more complex example.  The first thing in this page is the actual imports

-You'll notice that this file includes the same header and footer as the "index.jsp".  From there the jsp
-constructs an IndexSearcher with the "indexLocation" that was specified in the "configuration.jsp".  If there
-is an error of any kind in opening the index, it is diplayed to the user and a boolean flag is set to tell 
-the rest of the sections of the jsp not to continue.

-From there, this jsp attempts to get the search criteria, the start index (used for paging) and the maximum
-number of results per page.  If the maximum results per page is not set or not valid then it and the 
-start index are set to default values.  If only the start index is invalid it is set to a default value.  If 
-the criteria isn't provided then a servlet error is thrown (it is assumed that this is the result of url tampering

-The jsp moves on to construct a StandardAnalyzer just as in the simple demo, to analyze the search critieria, it 
-is passed to the QueryParser along with the criteria to construct a Query object.  You'll also notice the 
-string literal "contents" included.  This is to specify the search should include the  contents and not 
-the title, url or some other field in the indexed documents.  If there is any error in constructing a Query 
-object an error is displayed to the user.
+The jsp moves on to construct a <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/analysis/standard/StandardAnalyzer.html">StandardAnalyzer</a></code> to
+analyze the search text.  This matches the analyzer used during indexing (<code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexHTML.html">IndexHTML</a></code>), which is generally
+recommended.  This is passed to the <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.html">QueryParser</a></code> along with the
+criteria to construct a <code><a href="api/org/apache/lucene/search/Query.html">Query</a></code>
+object.  You'll also notice the string literal <code>"contents"</code> included.  This specifies
+that the search should cover the <code>contents</code> field and not the <code>title</code>,
+<code>url</code> or some other field in the indexed documents.  If there is any error in
+constructing a <code><a href="api/org/apache/lucene/search/Query.html">Query</a></code> object an
+error is displayed to the user.
 </p>
 <p>
-In the next section of the jsp the IndexSearcher is asked to search given the query object.  The results are
-returned in a collection called "hits".  If the length property of the hits collection is 0 then an error 
-is displayed to the user and the error flag is set.

+length property of the <code>hits</code> collection is 0 (meaning there were no results) then an
+error is displayed to the user and the error flag is set.
 </p>
 <p>
-Finally the jsp iterates through the hits collection and displayed properties of the "Document" objects we talked
-about in the first walkthrough.  These objects contain "known" fields specific to their indexer (in this case 
-"IndexHTML" constructs a document with "url", "title" and "contents").  You'll notice that these results are paged
-but the search is repeated every time.  This is an area where optimization could improve performance for large 
-result sets.
+Finally the jsp iterates through the <code>hits</code> collection, taking the current page into
+account, and displays properties of the <code><a

+<code><a href="api/org/apache/lucene/demo/IndexHTML.html">IndexHTML</a></code> constructs a document
+with "url", "title" and "contents").
+</p>
+<p>
+Please note that in a real deployment of Lucene, it's best to instantiate <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/search/IndexSearcher.html">IndexSearcher</a></code> and <code><a
+href="api/org/apache/lucene/queryParser/QueryParser.html">QueryParser</a></code> once, and then
+share them across search requests, instead of re-instantiating per search request.

-There are additional sources used by the web app that were not specifically covered by either walkthrough.  For 
-example the HTML parser, the IndexHTML class and HTMLDocument class.  These are very similar to the classes 
-covered in the first example, however they have properties sepecific to parsing and indexing HTML.  This is 
-beyond our scope; however, by now you should feel like you're "getting started" with Lucene.
